Besides visiting many ancient cities, Kevin and I had a great time enjoying the Turkish Riviera which roughly encompasses the area of southwestern Turkey between Izmir to a little ways beyond Antalya. We didn’t end up making it all the way to Antalya, but managed to get as far east as Demre before flying to central Turkey to Cappadocia. We loved spending a good chunk of time splashing around in the Mediterranean Sea especially as each dip felt extra welcome when it was so hot outside.

After Selçuk, which was our first stop post-Istanbul to visit Ephesus, we traveled by train onwards to Pamukkale, a city known for beautiful white travertines pooled with saturated calcium carbonate water. We decided to try out the Turkish rail system to travel to Pamukkale and it was quite something. First there was the challenge of finding the platform; you’d be surprised at how difficult it was to figure out what platform our train was going to arrive on even though there were only two! Each individual we talked to pointed to a different platform and we dashed between them until we figured that the dispatcher is probably the one to trust. Adding to the confusion was that there were two trains, each with the same endpoints, traveling in opposite directions, but arriving at Denizli station at exactly the same time. Luckily our bet was correct. Woohoo!

Oh and then there was the whole thing of finding our seats. We thought we had booked specific seats on the train but upon clambering on, we couldn’t find our seats. So we sat in random seats. Which actually worked out great for approximately two thirds of our trip until we got kicked out and then we went on a hunt for our seats again. Turns out, we were in the wrong car and the seat numbers hopped around so we didn’t think to actually go through each row, seat by seat, to figure out where our reserved seats had been. Anyways we plopped down, only to find out that the AC stopped working on the train and the remainder of the five hour journey was spent sweltering in a closed train car while it spiked above 40 degrees Celsius outside. Honestly, getting _off_ the train into the 40 degree heat directly felt great compared to sitting inside. But we made it!

A lot of what was written about Pamukkale stated that it was overrated and we shouldn’t expect much but perhaps because of those low expectations, the travertines blew us away. They are incredibly beautiful and I’ve never seen anything quite like it. The drippy cotton white travertines are visible even from town but seeing them up close in the early morning light was beautiful. There was one large area of the travertines where you could walk across barefoot and wade in the pools. They aren’t deep enough to fully sit unless you’re under ten years of age, but we loved paddling our way through the pools and smushing our feet into the soft clay. We got to the pools quite early so we beat all the large tour groups descending onto the site which made the experience even better.

The sides of the travertines looked like snowy icicles! Or drippy vanilla ice cream?

We loved the pools so much that we splashed out for tickets for a second visit at sunset. My goodness, the colors after the sun had set were gorgeous! We were speed walking up the travertines to catch the orange orb before it set, a rather tricky thing given how sharp the edges of the ripples of the dry travertines can be compared to the softness inside the pool, but luckily we made it. Bonus, the cat we had made friends with when we visited the travertines in the morning decided to hang out with us again at sunset! We were initially trying to get there to see the sun setting (and we caught the tail end of that) but the real show happened during the waning moments of civil twilight; the sky seemed to burst into all sorts of pastel colors that reflected beautifully in the still water of the travertines. At one point I thought to myself that I was done taking photos and sat myself down on a bench only for the sky to somehow get even more beautiful.

I might need to order a print of this once we’re done traveling. This is one of my favorite photos of the whole trip so far.

In the area, there was also a much less visited set of travertines that were underground in some caves. We paid a visit to those travertines the following day. They were pretty small, but worth the visit. It was small enough that I decided to walk through them twice. I’ve been working on trying to improve my photography skills by working my way through an online course so I had a bit of fun trying to take some photos a) in bad lighting and learning about aperture controls and b) playing with shutter speed to capture motion. Being in a cave with flowing water was great for that. Unfortunately, playing with my camera settings means that I have far too many pictures that I need to go through and delete at the end of every day; the most so far is 192 photos shot in one day. I’ve been doing a little more on-the-fly deletions since that day. I think Kevin once mentioned that he had taken more pictures so far this year than in 10 years prior.

I had some fun playing around with motion blur and dripping water from the stalactites in the caves.

From Pamukkale, we took a bus to Fethiye and then a taxi transfer to Ölüdeniz, now for some proper beach time. While I may not have the best things to say about the Turkish train ride we took, the bus was _fantastic_. What a brilliant move on the company’s part to hand out ice creams upon departure when it’s blistering hot outside. 10 out of 10. And then a guy came around to check each and every passenger’s AC grate to make sure it was working. Perhaps I get a little too excited by free snacks and working AC, but it’s the small things, you know?

In Ölüdeniz, we had a great time paragliding and spending some time chilling at the beach. Similar to the Albanian beaches, there are sunbeds and umbrellas neatly packed and aligned throughout the beaches available for rental, but we found more stretches of beach where we could just spread out our pack towels and chill. We don’t have too many pictures from these activities because, of course, water. I did end up busting my (ok, yes I stole it from Kevin) Fitbit though; the screen no longer turns on even though the other sensors work. It was supposed to be waterproof! Bit of a bummer because I was using it throughout all of our water activities to tell time without our phones but alas, add that to the casualty list. Oh yeah, speaking of casualty list, my wide angle lens went for a swim in a calcium carbonate water canal in Pamukkale which was a bit much for the Olympus “weather-proof” claims. That’s now on its way to Ohio so I can fix it later. Darn, that was my favorite lens. And I’m down two shirts: one that got a hole two weeks into travel (never buying Icebreaker again) and another white (erm, maybe _off-white_ is a more accurate description) shirt that I carelessly dried on a rusted metal railing after running out of space on the clothesline. As one could imagine, the rust imprinted right onto my shirt like those iron-on patches from the 1990s. Around once a week, I end up reciting Kevin’s ski coach’s wise words: “tools, not jewels.”

Paragliding. I took this photo from our launching pad, but the paraglider is not either of us. We flew in the same area though!

From the nearby airport, we rented a car to meander our way through the coast using the city of Kaş as our base. On our way to Kaş, we stopped by a gorgeous gorge called Saklıkent where we did a canyon hike mirroring the Narrows hike in Zion. It was a fun hike where we had to clamber over boulders and wade through waist-high water to reach a small waterfall at the end but I was especially impressed with a dad we passed who had a sleeping child on his back who managed to get to the waterfall without rousing the child. I nearly fell into the water multiple times so how he managed to climb without slipping and with minimal disturbance blows my mind. There were tons of people towards the beginning of the trail with children who were splashing around in the icy water but as we trekked upstream, there were fewer people and (strangely) warmer waters.

From Saklıkent, we headed to Patara for more ancient city exploration and beach fun. Patara beach was definitely the largest beach we’d been to so far. It was long enough that we were able to walk a little ways to find a stretch of nearly empty beach. One of the perks about being a Turkish citizen is that every year, you can purchase a Museum Card for you and your family; this card gives you free access to pretty much any museum or site in all of Turkey including everything from the Hagia Sofia to Patara to Pamukkale. Because Patara beach is attached to the Patara ruins and the Patara archeological site requires a fee for foreigners to visit, this beach was far less populated with tourists. Turkish citizens could visit Patara beach alone without paying using the museum card so there were plenty of Turkish summer vacationers there. Patara beach was amazing until I got stabbed by something in the bottom of my foot and I limp-ran out of the sea and spent the rest of the visit lying on my towel while Kevin piled the beach’s warmed pebbles on me. Felt like a hot stone massage! I still don’t know what got into my foot and nothing was bleeding but it still aches a tiny bit even after all this time. That’s twice now that the Mediterranean has thrown me out!

During our time in Kaş, we made more of an effort to cook with all the amazing produce around. [This Taverna Salad](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025202-taverna-salad?smid=ck-recipe-iOS-share) recipe from NYTimes Cooking was so perfect for the hot summer weather and Turkish fresh produce; we tweaked it by adding a boatload of dill and serving it with the local _simit_ rather than pita. That plus the candy floss-tasting Turkish melon called _kirkağac_ for dessert was such a wonderful way to celebrate all the summer produce! Honestly, we were both a bit tired of baklava and its drippy sugary sweetness overload by that point so the melon was absolutely perfect.

Finishing out our trip to the Turkish Riviera, I was thinking about how important this area was to catalyzing a whole chapter of history devoted to pushing the boundaries of exploration in an effort to gain a trade advantage which then dominoed into the era of colonialism. A large tract of the Mediterranean Sea was under Ottoman control which meant that they could levy taxes at will for any merchant who wished to use the naval paths for trade. Eventually the Spanish and Portuguese became the first to tire of paying the taxes and invested in research to find an alternative path to the east, catalyzing the Age of Exploration. And we know what happened from there. Our kayaking guide remarked that it’s one of the reasons why Turkey (and neighboring nations) never had any colonies; they simply never needed them because they controlled the sea. Every time I learn a little bit of history, I get amazed by how much those events of the past have so dramatically shaped our present and will shape our future.

One last tidbit: we learned that the country does not prefer the use of “Turkey” as the country’s name. It’s actually “Türkiye” which is roughly pronounced “turkey-yay.” We noticed this while watching the Euro football games when the commentators would say “turkey-yay.” Also the natives of the country also pronounces it that way. A little internet research unearthed that the government prefers that pronunciation as it better reflects its culture and values. So I’ll try to use that moving forward!
