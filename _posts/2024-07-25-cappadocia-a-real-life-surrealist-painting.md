To date, we’ve been very lucky with our travel luck. Latam, the dominant airline in South America, is one of the most on time airlines in the world and true to their reputation, flights always took off on time or even early. Our long haul flights have generally departed without delay as well. We’ve only lost one sock so far. But alas, our streak ended with my lost luggage enroute to Cappadocia, in central Turkey. We connected in Istanbul from Dalaman airport and with a somewhat tight connection, my bag didn’t make it. I have to thank my sister once again for one of the best Christmas gifts I’ve ever gotten, which is a set of Tiles that helped me locate my bag in Istanbul. Those Tiles saved our butts once before when our skis didn’t make it with us to Lyon and it saved me again here as Turkish Airlines wasn’t really sure where the bag was and I could locate it to find out that it made it at least halfway. But all ended well; I miraculously packed just the right stuff in my daypack that I lasted until the following afternoon with only needing to buy a toothbrush and a small bottle of lotion. Honestly, there was a part of me that was thinking it wouldn’t be so bad to have it lost since I’d get the opportunity to buy a fresh set of all my belongings. But it would definitely be a bit of a hassle.

One of the most iconic things to do in Cappadocia is fly in a hot air balloon over the unique rock formations that the area is renowned for. We had another stroke of luck here; before we arrived, we messaged our guesthouse host to let him know we wanted to fly in a hot air balloon and he recommended we do it straightaway (i.e. the next morning) after we got in. After my lost luggage situation, we see-sawed a bit wondering whether to cancel because a) it was late by the time we arrived and the call time was 4am and b) I only had the clothes on my body to wear and it was going to be very cold at 4am. We decided to power through and go for it as one bit of additional luck I had was that I had packed a puffer jacket in my daypack, since I tend to turn into an ice cube on airplanes. As our trip went on we found out that every single balloon ride was canceled for the remainder of our time in Cappadocia due to high winds so we were very very glad that we decided to not cancel our booking!

Uprighting the basket!

The hot air balloon ride is up there in the top things we’ve done on this entire trip so far. We drove out to the middle of a field in the darkness and watched as the crew laid down the balloon shell on the dried grass and blew two high powered fans into the bottom to blow it up. While the crew worked to inflate the balloon, we nursed some cups of hot tea, coffee and cocoa as the first of the other balloons quietly rose in the air against the cracking of dawn. The balloons remind me of brightly coloured candy wrappers in a kid’s Halloween haul. Seeing them rise against the darkened sky was especially cool; we watched as the silhouettes of the balloons rose and when the hot flames were ignited to give the balloon lift, the balloon’s colorful canvas would be lit up, especially beautiful against the dark background.

Eventually it was our turn to go up. We climbed into the huge basket, four people to a capsule, seven capsules in total and I peered over the edge watching the basket firmly sat on the grass thinking there’s no way that just a few blasts of hot air can possibly _lift_ this basket straight into the air. And yet, that’s exactly what happened. A few moments after the pilot blasted the powerful flames into the balloon, the basket quietly lifted up and began its ascent into the morning air. I tell you, physics is just absolutely magical.

Staring at this picture now, I still can’t believe it’s real! I promised it’s not photoshopped in any way!

</figcaption>

Perhaps the most surprising thing about being in a hot air balloon is how quiet everything is. When the pilot ignites the flame, it is momentarily loud (and delightfully warm) but then all is quiet except for the light murmurings of the other passengers in the basket and the occasional clicks of cameras. Both Kevin and I absolutely loved the experience and hopefully we get to do it again one day. I’ve always had a childhood dream to ride in a hot air balloon ever since my family would watch an annual late summer hot air balloon show growing up in Ohio. Finally fulfilled!

Post-balloon, we returned back to our hotel to get a bit of rest and see if my bag would arrive so that I could get my hiking boots which are necessary to be able to comfortably get traction on the loose gravel of the rock formations.Unfortunately it didn’t arrive until the late afternoon but we did manage to go out for a bit to see the Göreme Open Air museum. This outdoor protected area is filled with cone-shaped tuff (a soft volcanic rock material) formations that were carved into Christian monasteries and churches. The whole Cappadocia area has a fascinating history, primarily as refuge for Christians who sought safety from persecution throughout various times in history: first during the early Christianity period when they sought to practice their faith away from Roman persecution and again during the Ottoman period when the dominant religion became Islam and once again Christian hid in the rock formations to practice in peace. Some of the paintings are still in quite good condition even after so many years and it was really cool to be able to explore the nooks in the rocks freely.

This was a cool built-in dining area with the remains of a painting of the Last Supper on the wall.

In Cappadocia, one never needs to buy any snacks. Everywhere you look, there are wild apricot trees that are absolutely loaded with tiny sweet fruit, sidewalks lined with tart Oregon grapes, and occasionally a cherry tree or two loaded with so much shiny red fruit that I wasn’t 100% it wasn’t some sort of poisonous fruit because certainly I would have thought the birds would have gotten to it first. Kevin ran into a similar problem as in Patagonia; we would be walking together and suddenly after a minute, he’d look back and not see me. Where was I? Back there, trying to shake down an apricot tree for more sweet snacks. I was warned by our host that I should be careful not to eat too many lest I get a stomach ache but my stomach held on even after I consumed 20 apricots in one day. They were too addicting! It’s really hard to beat freshly picked tree-ripen fruit. Kevin wasn’t a big fan of the fruit, but he got to climb lots of apricot trees instead!

So many cherries! I used Gemini to verify that these indeed were actually cherries and not something poisonous. Kevin was shaking his head in disbelief on the side and did not condone my use of AI :)

</figcaption>

The following day, we went on a tour called the “Green Tour” which goes through the southwestern part of Cappadocia, including visiting an underground city called Derinkuyu and an impressive monastery called Selime. The underground city was unbelievable. It extends 85 meters underground (~280 feet) and could fit around 20,000 people (I double checked to make sure the number of zeroes was correct). I don’t tend to feel any claustrophobia but as we descended deeper and deeper into the maze (i think we only got as far as around 50 something meters) and the tunnels got smaller and smaller (I had an easier time than most with my small stature but even I was crouched over to navigate the passageways), I was also looking forward to coming out into the open air. We were all stretching ourselves a bit once we got to the stables (yes, stables _inside_ the underground city) which were spacious enough to fully stand and wide enough to roam around a bit. What an amazing experience though! I can hardly believe such an entire city exists and it’s even more amazing that there were people living there up until the 1920s!

These look like the onion domes of Russian orthodox churches!

</figcaption>

One perhaps odd thing about Cappadocia is the number of pigeon houses that have been carved into the tuff; there are thousands of dovecotes carved into these “fairy chimneys” that were used to try to create a flourishing pigeon population. The pigeons were venerated for their poop (an excellent fertilizer and paint pigment) and for their more classic use as messengers.

Lots of pigeon holes carved into the interior of one of the rocks. You can find these both inside the rocks and on the exterior.

Oh! A bit random, but I needed to mention a dessert that we had in Göreme which I want to recreate at some point. Tahini molten lava cake. I think it had some white chocolate in there too. It was SO GOOD, just perfectly sweetened, no skimping on the tahini, and served with a small scoop of both plain lightly-vanilla-y ice cream and some plain yogurt (I would alternate between a bit of cake+yogurt and cake+ice cream), it was just amazing. We actually had something very similar in Albania as well which was instead a pistachio lava cake. So good and unique and it was just as I prefer my cakes, not too sweet and no icky-sweet frosting. I’ve never thought to have a lava cake made of something that was _not_ chocolate and I didn’t expect to like a non-chocolate cake but here we are. Mmm, I could eat another one of those right now and I just had a ginormous breakfast.

Our last day in Cappadocia was a fun one; we rented a scooter to scoot around to more sights in the more northern area of Cappadocia. We decided to try out renting a single scooter rather than one each; we both have previous experience riding but never with something else in the back. The rental company dropped off the shiny blue scooter in front of our hotel and gave us a two minute crash course, which erm, we probably only understood about 50% of. We came back to the scooter after grabbing our bag from our room and I confidently sat in the front aaaaand could not figure out for the life of me how to turn it on. It really must not have emitted any sort of confidence for anyone watching, seeing two foreigners poke various buttons and peer into the crevices of the scooter trying to figure out how to even turn it on. We did eventually wave a white flag and got our host to redo our crash course and with a bit of wobbling, I drove us through the city onto the blissfully wide and paved main road.

<figcaption>

Whee!

</figcaption>

What a super fun day! We scooted between various cool landmarks and since we were on our own schedule, we could hike and explore the area as we wished which also meant we escaped the main crowds there to photograph the primary features. Imagination Valley was really cool; it reminded me a bit of Bryce Canyon with the tops of the rock formations wind-eroded away like the hoodoos. At Imagination Valley, we switched drivers and Kevin did a test run driving from one viewpoint to another super close by, just around a bend. I jogged behind him, looking ridiculous in a huge DOT helmet and as I was laughing at the state of what it must have looked like (Kevin driving off without me) a kindly old man stopped his car to give me a ride to the viewpoint. I don’t think we understood a single word of each other but we were both laughing as he continued to blast his radio (it was a miracle the radio was working because it was nearly falling out of the chassis) and the car rattled its way down to where Kevin had just parked the scooter. I think this might have been my first time “hitchhiking.”

Stop 1: Uçhisar Castle. This was a really fun area to be able to explore with great views from the top of the castle (on the left with the flag).

These formations were called the “3 Beauties.” They are each just a single rock even though the tops look like they’re balancing on a main pedestal.

Having our own mode of transportation instead of being on a planned tour also meant that we could pick our own places to stop for food. Around lunchtime, we decided to try to find a place to eat some pide, Turkish pizza, which was one thing we hadn’t yet tried. In the next city in our self-planned “tour” we found one which was probably one of the most local, hole-in-the-wall eateries we have eaten at in all of Turkey. It was a tiny little place with a blazing hot pizza oven, a bit dirty and dingy perhaps, that made one thing: pide. There was no menu. A young boy asked us in simple English. What type of pide would you have? No meat, yes meat? And anything to drink? That’s it. The locals were served pide on a piece of brown butcher paper that was spread across their table. We got real plates. And boy was the pide delicious! I’m really glad we got to experience pide at such a local shop; it was not too cheesy with the crust artfully thin, the edges gently folded over to keep in the filling from oozing and served with a few chiles that tasted like Papa John’s pepperoncinis.

We ended our day hiking through the gorgeous Red and Rose Valleys that are filled with pointed rock formations that look, to me, like scoops of Neapolitan ice cream. Sometimes strawberry ice cream. This was a really great hike that had hardly any other people on it besides a few people towards the start of the trail taking some photographs. Or some professional photographs as we saw a couple of ladies in billowing dresses with long trains that were tossed into the air as a photographer with a long lens snapped away. We were quite comfortable with the scooter by this point so we off-roaded the scooter into the sand to a closer parking lot to save us a couple kilometers of walking. AllTrails came in handy again as the route wasn’t exactly the most well marked (though better marked than I expected!) and there were lots of ways to get lost through the valley between the cones. We stumbled into lots of random things in the middle of the hike. One was a church that apparently was in the process of restoration as some sort of partnership between Turkey and Japan; there was a gate but umm, we got curious with the splotches of red paint wooing us and squeezed through the bottom corner (they should have built a better gate!) to get in and take some pictures of the gorgeous art. We also ran into a completely random cafe/tea garden in the middle of the hike, smack dab hidden away in the thick greenery on the valley floor. It seemed like such an odd place to have a cafe because you’d have to hike quite far to get there; perhaps they get better business during other times of the year?

Gorgeous frescoes in the church we snuck into.

</figcaption>

Perhaps one of the more adventurous parts of the hike was when AllTrails seemed to take the trail directly straight to one of the rocks. Weird, maybe it was a mistake. Nope, it was not. We found a tilted ladder against the groove between two of the Neapolitan ice cream cones with tiny foot steps carved the rest of the way. In the end, it was not bad at all as the ladder was mostly secured into the rock but I definitely had a moment of, uhhh, I hope there’s another way around! We got diverted away from a different climb earlier on in the hike by another father-son duo who owned a cafe again nestled in the hills (though this one was closer to a trail head) but the diversion took us down a beautiful scenic viewpoint where we had a stunning view of Rose Valley with the last of the sun’s rays illuminating the rock.

With that, our time in Turkey came to an end. We ended our last day in Göreme, fittingly, stuffing ourselves with a last plate of mixed mezzes, soft pita, and a plate of pistachio baklava with some vanilla ice cream. Our plan was to go directly to our next continent, Africa, to Port Elizabeth, South Africa directly from Cappadocia but it turns out, that’s a somewhat complicated set of flights so we took a stop in Munich to a) restock on a few things (gotta deal with that sunken lens) and b) see a Euros match!!! But that’s for another post!
