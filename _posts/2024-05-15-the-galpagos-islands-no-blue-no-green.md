I can’t quite remember exactly what the context was for the answer, but one of us on our speeding zodiac asked Christopher, our guide for our 6 days in the Galápagos, about his lasting enthusiasm to go on trip after trip in the Galágpagos for over a decade. He responded with a quote from American marine biologist Sylvia Earl: “No blue, no green.” He elaborated on about the world to be still explored underneath the soft waves of the Pacific Ocean and how it hides from human eyes, save for the 45 or 60 minute dips where we faceplant into the sea with hopes of glimpsing the secret world for ourselves. Every dip reveals something new to see and discover, which never gets old. Without this magnificent underwater world, the land that we spend most of our time on would not exist.

This harmony between “blue” and “green” was very central during our time in the Galápagos and I hope this post captures a smidgen of how extraordinary this visit was to these lands and seas.

Kevin and I ended our South American leg of our travels with quite a bang. We booked a fancy shmancy cruise on a catamaran to visit the central Galápagos Islands. We were joined on the boat by 5 other passengers (hi Yvonne, Nicole, Emily, Dean, and Jason!) and more than twice that number of staff who took amazing care of us from making sure we had snacks after every excursion, delicious freshly cooked meals (handmade pasta night!) and teaching us about Ecuadorian culture (including their traditional liquors). I read some advice that recommended that we try to book the smallest boat possible that was still within our budget and in all honesty, I took that advice, cross-filtered with our restrictive dates and booked the first one that I saw. Thank you random Reddit comment for a stunning recommendation!

The living room in the boat was so comfy and spacious! Our last overnight boat experience was in Norway where we were crammed into a tiny room with two cots and a sink.

</figcaption>

We spent each of the 6 days exploring different parts of different islands, though primarily visiting Isla Isabella Island and Isla Santa Cruz with stops on Fernandina and Santiago. Most days were split into two parts: doing activities at one location in the morning and then activities at a second location in the afternoon. The captain would move the boat to the new location typically during lunchtime and then in the middle of the night as we slept. I knew that picking a smaller boat increased the chance of seasickness (much more relevant for Antarctica cruises where the same advice to pick a small boat applies), but thankfully the seas were incredibly smooth and the gentle rocking actually helped me sleep so well at night. The giant king-sized bed with perfect firmness and a belly filled with gourmet, freshly cooked, sumptuous dinner helped as well I’m sure.

The 6 days were filled to the brim with astonishing interactions with the plentiful wildlife that has been carefully protected through rigorous regulations set by the Galápagos government. I’m really impressed with the way they have sought to minimize the human impact on the islands and how little evidence of human existence there appears to be. There are a handful of locations (restricted to just 4 of the islands) where people can actually live but besides that, the islands are left untouched (~97%). There are no bathrooms or trash cans and there’s only the odd trail marker that belies that humans have set foot on these lands. This means that every day, I wished for the neck agility of an owl; there were animals _everywhere_! I would be looking through the bushes during a hike to spot a tortoise only to suddenly realize that I almost just stepped on a land iguana. On a zodiac ride, I would be peering through the clear water to spot a shark, only to realize that a pelican was staring me down perched on the mangrove tree. Even in the water, I’d be trying to chase down a sea lion only to have a penguin zip past behind me, zooming through the water as if it had on a jetpack. I wished I had eyes everywhere so that I could look up and sideways and behind and down and bonus eyes that could see through water. I so wished I was a stronger swimmer to be able to have a bit more agility in the water as well. I’m signing up for swimming lessons as soon as I live in one place again!

I’m going to post several photos below of various animals we got to see! A bit of a photo diary of sorts.

We started off strong by seeing the Galápagos Giant Tortoises on our very first day. I caught this one mid-meal. Must have been some tasty grass with that drool.

We saw tons of land iguanas in Urbina Bay. These guys (like flamingos, the dudes get the vibrant yellow color… the women are grey-ish) did not care one bit about humans; I liked how they would plop themselves right on the trail on the edge of a shadow created by a nearby tree so that the would warm up, but not _too_ much. They look like dinosaurs don’t they?!

This tortoise’s moustache is from eating poison apples (“manzanilla de muerte”) — the apple is toxic to humans but the toxin helps tortoises digest the fibrous plants that they primarily eat. I think I found a perfect next spokesmodel for a “Got Milk” campaign.

An ice cream sundae’s worth of marine iguanas with a lizard cherry on top. There were _so_ many marine iguanas on Espinoza Point (hundreds) and I distinctly remember the smell of dead iguanas which was one of the most vile things I’ve smelt ever. On par with days old dead buffalo that has been partially picked away by vultures. The iguanas die because of scarcity of food resources in this huge colony. We got to swim with these guys as well — they look way less terrifying in the water compared to on land. Elegant even.

The highlight of the trip for me, however, was not in the itinerary nor any of the stunning wildlife that the Galápagos is known for. Around the end of March, a young volcano named La Cumbre began erupting on Fernandina Island. We happened to be visiting at just the right time when the lava that erupted had made its way down the slopes and was falling into the water off of one end of the island. During the evening of our second day of our trip, Captain Juan steered us right towards the lava flow so that we could see the lava dripping and splattering into the ocean. I’ve never seen anything like it and I was shocked into letting out a few expletives. It was completely mind blowing to see a glowing substance oozing off the island in a shocking red orange emitting smoke as if pirates had just destroyed a fleet of ships and sparking like 4th of July fireworks. It was breathtaking.

Another cool thing we got to do on this trip was cross the equator by sea. Captain Juan called us up to his realm on the fourth day of our trip to a) show off the cool instruments and equipment that he uses to navigate the waters and b) show the GPS reading 0 degrees as we crossed the line. It was a funny moment realizing that it was the first time we had been in the northern hemisphere in nearly 3 months (though we quickly returned back to the southern hemisphere that evening). I loved hearing about the catamaran navigational equipment too; I felt like the captain was really proud of his ship and his enthusiasm was contagious even though I know very little about sea navigation.

We left the Galapagos feeling extremely well rested, fed, and as if we had taken a vacation from our vacation. It was nice not having to plan anything for 6 days, what or when to eat or what activities to do. We dutifully applied sunscreen and donned appropriate gear when our guide recommended to do so and responded to summons to meet for a meal or an activity with 15 minutes of lead time. Each evening we plopped ourselves in the living room after showering off 3 or 4 layers of sunscreen as the guide went over the following day’s activities. Watching the water pass by from our little balcony or from the sundeck put me really at ease and feeling wonder about how lucky we were to have these kinds of experiences.

Finally, this post wouldn’t be complete without mentioning our wonderful shipmates for the duration of the trip. I mentioned this previously in the O trek and Bolivia posts, but being able to meet new people and share an extended experience with them really it extra special. It was so awesome that we got along so well and it made every snorkel, hike, boat ride, and meal so much more fun with great company. One of our shipmates, Jason, had an amazing camera setup and was kind enough to share the video he made compiling his footage with us. Kevin and I don’t have any equipment that can take underwater photos or videos so we are eternally grateful to have this video as a memory of the “blue”. I’ve attached it below! Thank you Jason!

And so, our time in South America has come to an end. Kevin is off to Vienna and I’m off to Spain and I can hardly believe that it’s already been more than 3 months since we’ve been on the road. Though, I did find Krispe Kreme donuts at the Guayaquil airport. Ahhh, the taste of America! Still is my favorite donut. I’m willing to fight that.

**Favorite things**:

- Galagents: this is the company that we used to book our Galapagos tour. Working with them was absolutely seamless (something I’ve started to value even more when a good chunk of my life right now is spent on booking things and planning travel) and we liked that this company is from Ecuador and does only Galapagos tours compared to other international companies that do tours all over the world (i.e. National Geographic, G Adventure, etc.). 
    
    - If you’re interested to see exactly what our itinerary was, you can find the nitty gritty details [here](https://www.siriusonboard.com/). We did Itinerary B. 
        

I admit, there’s a lot of seal butt in this video but this seal brought me so much joy in how playfully it was barrel rolling in the water. Playtime after breakfast sounds like a daily routine to aspire to.
