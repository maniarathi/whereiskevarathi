During our road trip through the Albanian Riviera, Kevin and I continued to listen to more episodes of the Fall of Civilizations podcast. We had been hoping that there would be an Ottoman Empire episode because we'd seen so many castles, bridges, and other vestigial constructions of the time during which Albania was under Ottoman rule (up until 1912 when they declared independence) and we figured it might be helpful context to understand the rise and fall of the empire before visiting these sites. Unfortunately, there was no Ottoman Empire episode so we settled on the previous empire's episode which would give us at least a history of the rise of the Ottoman Empire: the Byzantine Empire. It's a stunning episode of three and a half hours that I could not more strongly recommend, but at the end of the road trip (that's roughly how long it took for us to get through the entire episode), we knew where we had to go next: Constantinople.

I had wanted to visit Turkey for some time; ten years ago, after I had finished undergrad, my plan had been to visit Austria so that I could attend the Vienna Philharmonic's Ball and visit the birthplace of Mozart and then go to Turkey to see Pamukkale (I think I'd see the picture of the travertines on some blog or something). Unfortunately, I didn't end up going to Turkey at that time because I didn't think it was safe enough so ended up visiting Spain instead. I can't say I really knew what to expect of Istanbul besides that it was a big vibrant city that confections "Turkish Delight" that one of the kids in Narnia eats far too much of. And also they make nice towels. The podcast episodes hinted at more grandeur with the retelling of the history of the Hagia Sofia. I was pretty eagerly peering out the window as we landed into Istanbul, a quick hour and a half jaunt from Tiranë, though not seeing much because it was pitch dark.

We found some fun graffiti in the Karaköy neighbourhood though I've heard there's even more in the alleyways of Kadiköy.

</figcaption>

No matter! We got to exploring the sights of the city right away. The first things we went off to explore were the famous bazaars: the Grand Bazaar and the Spice Bazaar. I wanted to pick up a lightweight shawl that I could use to cover my head and shoulders while visiting mosques as well as a straw hat that I could wear with my one long dress since I couldn't wear my usual shorts in mosques either. I have to say, both Kevin and I found the bazaars interesting and certainly both visually and auditorily vibrant, but the shops were pretty much all selling exactly the same wares and were entirely filled with tourist shoppers. The shops all claimed to be selling silks and cashmeres even though I could tell by feel that the textiles were very much just polyester. The spice bazaar was also very interesting though we learned later that Western Turkish folks don't really use many spices at all in their cooking, partially because the soil in the area grows incredibly delicious fruits and vegetables that require few seasonings beyond salt, pepper and good olive oil. Eastern Turkey, on the other hand, where the lands border Syria, Iraq, and Iran, use far more spices and the famous "kebabs" are actually originally from that area. Nonetheless, visiting the bazaars was still a nice experience and we had some fun attempting to haggle down the price for my shawl. And by fun, I mean disastrous for me! I can't believe I froze while trying to haggle; where did all those skills from haggling in India go?! Kevin stepped in and did a great job cutting down the price by 100 lira though!

<em>Outside</em> of the specific bazaars, I think there are much better shopping experiences to be had in Istanbul. The streets are absolutely filled with crammed little nooks selling textiles, lamps, electronic parts, towels, anything you can think of, that spill onto the sidewalk. We loved eating 10 lira sesame "pretzels" called <em>simit</em> and drinking freshly squeezed pomegranate juice from the street vendors. You can smell the grilled corn and roasted chestnuts in front of all the major tourist sites from the same street carts and as you got closer to ports abutting the Golden Horn or Bosphorus Strait, stuffed mussels and lemon. While we didn't do much in the way of shopping beyond our brief Grand Bazaar experience, we certainly made up for it with our food explorations.

These packed small alleys are where the real shopping experiences are to be had.

Eating in Istanbul was incredible. Whenever I get back to living in one place, I plan to host a "dips for dinner" dinner party where I try to recreate all the mezzes we tried. Atom Meze (one of my favorites) features sautéed spicy chiles and raw garlic swirled into thick yogurt. There was another yogurt based meze that was like tzatziki except substituting roasted red peppers for cucumbers. I want to see if I can find a jar of "biber salçasi" which is sort of like Turkish harissa that is liberally used in "menemen" (Turkish-style shakshuka that features scrambled eggs instead of poached eggs) and in "acili ezme", another Turkish meze that's similar to a spicy salsa. The yogurt in Turkey is really exceptional; it's closest to Greek yogurt in consistency without the tang and I have shocked myself with how much of it I can eat. Maybe it was the heat though; while we were in Istanbul, it was consistently hitting 32 or 33 degrees Celsius (~90F) and walking around in that heat made me crave yogurt, dondurma (Turkish ice cream that has a slightly stretchy texture), and ice cold water. One other thing that I found interesting is that in Albania, many of the guest houses offered "Turkish coffee" for breakfast which contains unfiltered, finely ground coffee beans and certainly, that style of coffee is pretty much ubiquitous in Turkey. However, <em>tea</em> (or "çay" in Turkish which is pronounced "chai") is drunk way more commonly which suited just fine for me as I love tea. 90 degrees outside? No matter, I'm still drinking tea. The tea leaves used are nothing fancy; it's just strongly brewed Ceylon tea. But there's a strong <em>culture</em> of drinking tea as a quick way to catch up with someone or to take a quick break in the day. It's primarily drunk in a small 4 ounce bulb-shaped glass with a sugar cube swirled in, I think probably to help cut the bitterness since it's steeped very strongly.

How do I describe the mosques of Istanbul? I wish I had a stronger vocabulary to describe how beautiful these mosques were. We visited 4 mosques (Suleymaniye, Yeni Cami, The Blue Mosque, and the Hagia Sofia) during our time in Istanbul, each with its own fascinating history and unique architectures that always features intricate colorful tiling, plush detailed carpets, chandeliers that dangle low to the carpet strung from the tops of the domes to prevent blocking the view of gorgeous paintings. The first one we went to called Suleymaniye had a few screens set up throughout the outer perimeter of the praying area that described some of the core principles of Islam as well as why certain elements of the mosque exist as they are. For example, the "Mihrab" is a niche in a wall that is always constructed in the direction of Mecca, but in the Hagia Sofia, since it was originally constructed as a church, the Mihrab is separated from the wall as the wall itself doesn't point towards Mecca and so everyone is praying at a slight angle in relation to the room. I'll post several photos below with each of the mosques we went to.

The Hagia Sofia (or Aya Sofia). "Hagia" was used when it was used as a church and "Aya" is now used as it operates as a mosque. Interestingly, the Hagia Sofia was entirely a museum up until 2020 when it reverted back to being an active mosque.

<figcaption>

When the Hagia Sofia operated as a church, there were three Seraphim painted near the dome. After it turned into a mosque, the Seraphim were covered (on the left). However in the restoration process prior to 2020 when the Hagia Sofia became a museum, they decided to leave one face uncovered as a nod to its history (on the right).

One of our favorite experiences was actually not on the main tourist track. After listening to that episode of the Fall of Civilizations, we really wanted to see the famed three-layer wall that was impregnable for over a thousand years until cannons were invented. Parts of the wall still exist today but they are pretty far away from all of the other major sites that sit closer to the water's edge. We took a local bus out to the wall where we were able to walk alongside it for some ways. Even with all the overgrown grasses and weeds peeking out from what is left standing, it's incredible to think about what these walls have endured and seen and how important they were to keeping the Byzantine Empire alive until the last of its days. The walls are not really a particular "site" but there was one gate, "Belgradkapi," that looked like it was more of a site with some boards and also ongoing restoration work. Since it was Eid and everything was closed, we were free to explore the walls as we wished and there was absolutely no one else there. A security officer opened up a small rest area and offered us some cool water as it was unremittingly hot that day.

Speaking of hot, it was SO HOT. Most days were 32 degrees or more (90 degrees fahrenheit). We did our best to try to avoid walking around in the peak of heat, but it was hard to avoid. One very <em>cool</em> visit (wink wink), was to the Basilica Cistern, a 6th century subterranean cistern that housed water that served not only Topkapi Palace nearby, but also the surrounding neighborhoods. It's a really beautifully constructed cistern, hilariously with two upside down Medusas that were brought in as reused material to act as bases for two of the columns. I liked that they also added some more modern sculptures and artwork to the cistern which made the cistern also a sort of art museum. Side note about the heat: little did I know that we had hotter weather ahead of us averaging high 30s to 40 degrees (100+ degrees fahrenheit). As I write this sentence in the early morning down in the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, it is 32 degrees and after acclimatization, this feels absolutely comfortable to me. I even turned off the AC. The adaptation capabilities of human bodies astound me.

I won't write too much about some of the other touristic activities we did in Istanbul but I will say that the museums in Istanbul are really fantastic and incredibly rich. The Istanbul Archeological Museum is such a treasure trove and I was amazed at how many well preserved statues and friezes there were. In contrast to many other museums we've been to in other countries, it seems like Istanbul has been able to maintain control of the artifacts found in the area; the exception is that Austria seems to have a good number due to several excavation projects in Turkey being led by Austrian researchers (for example, Vienna has their own entire Ephesus museum even though the ancient city of Ephesus is in Turkey). The Topkapi Palace was also humongous and a wonderful visit. We had to rush through it a bit due to time, but seeing the intricate patterns and embroidery work of the royal kafkans, the intricate pattern work on the domes of the pavilions that are quintessential of Ottoman architecture, as well as some French Rococo style influence on some of the later built structures was really such a fantastic walk through time. A long walk — the palace was really extensive with four huge courtyards, each with multiple structures that housed everything from the kitchen to the royal mint, and all of which we could explore. The Hagia Sofia Museum was absolutely wild; we were handed what we thought were audio guides as we entered the museum. We were directed to put the headphones on right away and hang the device that looks like a Walkman around our necks. Then, as we entered each room, the device automatically activated to begin the music and narration for the room. Except the rooms were screens and booming surround sound played while the screens retold the history of the Hagia Sofia with full movie effects. It was a pretty fun experience, very dramatic, and at the end of passing through the screen rooms, there were also some rooms that had some real artifacts, more like a traditional museum, to check out. To be fair, the history of the Hagia Sofia is pretty dramatic so the movie effects seem worth it. Someone should actually make a movie if there isn't one already. Also, if someone hasn't made a reality TV show about the bickering Greek gods, that should happen too. My god were those folks drama llamas.

Mark my words, one day some of the directors of the French haute couture houses are going to see this statue and suddenly Paris Fashion week will be full of ridiculous ornate headdresses like this. They say that fashion comes in cycles; how about a two thousand year cycle?

Seriously. The headdresses.

Last, but definitely not least, the ferries in Istanbul are awesome! We read a Reddit tip to skip the touristic "Bosphorus Cruises" that cost 20 or more euros and take the regular ferries that shuttle people across the Bosphorus to various neighborhoods of Istanbul that cost less than a dollar. We did that four times. We went out to visit Kadiköy, on the Asian side of Istanbul, twice. It's a lovely, more modern neighborhood with a bit more of an international, younger, and slightly more hippy vibe. Taking the ferry after dark was so cool, seeing the mosques all lit up and all the lights of Istanbul dotting the night sky. And we saw a stunning thunderstorm! Luckily the downpour didn't last very long and the weather was blissfully cooler that following day.

I got lucky with this shot. The lightning sometimes came in sets so if I clicked fast enough on the first flash, I managed to get the shot of the second or third flash. I got three photos total but this one was easily the best.

</figcaption>

Our last day in Istanbul was pretty hilarious; we had a flight to Izmir in the afternoon and decided to visit a couple of last sights in the morning. Well, let's just say things did not work out. We took a funicular and metro to a palace in Beşiktaş, and it was closed. Then we thought we'd go and revisit Kadiköy taking the ferry across. Turns out, the ferry was absolutely packed with news cameras taking videos of the stampede that followed after opening the gates to the next ferry. So to avoid getting smushed, we thought, ah, we'll go and visit our favorite ice cream shop in Sultanahmet. Took a metro to get there, but it too was closed. Then we attempted round 2 of getting to Kadiköy which <em>was</em> successful only to realize we didn't have enough time to see or do anything so we took the next ferry right back. We underestimated how shut everything would be for Eid and how much of all the people of Istanbul would be out and about due to the holidays. Hey, at least we got to experience all of the different modes of transportation in one day: taxi, funicular, metro, ferry, and plane!

I'll end the post here. If Istanbul is not yet on your list of places to visit, definitely add it. We have loved our time in Turkey so far and Istanbul was such a vibrant, energetic, and colorful place to visit. No wonder Emperor Constantine decided to name it the capital of the Byzantine Empire!

**Favorite places to eat**:

- [Tershane Karaköy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HGp66jhX8y3dex6SA?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): on the eighth floor of a hotel, this place had really amazing food with a beautiful sweeping view of Istanbul. This place is a Michelin recommended restaurant and deservedly so.

- [Bena Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BMkUfg18rsxFgWjH7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): most of the stalls that claim to serve Turkish ice cream in the touristic areas are selling the experience of pranking you by appearing to take your ice cream away by sleight of hand. This place is exactly the opposite. They have maybe four or five flavors of authentic dondurma and the guy serving is no-nonsense, cranking through the line of customers reaching out through the back door in no time. We got a scoop of caramel and a scoop of chocolate and tried to come back again later a different day but alas it was closed due to Eid.

- [Lades Menemen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AG9oSGCQqPBBYsC29?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): it's a place that specializes in mememen which is a sort of Turkish shakshuka dish with scrambled rather than poached eggs. It looks highly unappetizing (imagine liquidy scrambled eggs, gross) but it tastes so so good. Extremely un-instagrammable.

- [Antiochia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8fG71dHy6aQXZYH19?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): dips on dips! Get the 8 dip platter. So good.

- [Berlin Platz Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R9TuL97U8nd2oqRR6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): in the hip Kadiköy neighborhood, we enjoyed a break from Turkish food here with really solid burgers and a huge selection of beers. The Euros were going on so this place was _packed_.

- [Etabal Ari Ürünleri](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oipnfjaXhVqVwAWF8?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): this shop specializes in honey products. Get a cup of their yogurt which the shopkeeper drizzles on a generous amount of fresh honey from the comb on top. IT WAS SO GOOD!

- [Flekk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/axvr1Rrsr9fYU1SA6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): an excellent bar with strong, inventive, and tasty drinks.

I've said little about the street cats of Turkey who are truly the rulers of the country. I'm saving that for another post later because I have too many amazing photos of cats. But I'll leave this one of this cutie who decided that under my dinner seat would be her spot to beg for dinner scraps. She won with this look.
