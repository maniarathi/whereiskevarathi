Currently I'm sitting at the border of Chile and Bolivia waiting for our turn to exit Chile. We're on our way to visit the Bolivian Salt Flats which are close to the Atacama Desert where we've been for the last four days. I've been eagerly waiting for an opportunity to sit and write but instead, my iPad and keyboard are stashed away in the back of the van and typing on my service-less phone, at least to begin, will have to do! I suspect that it will take me a few days to fully flesh out this post and that it will be long so I hope you're in a comfy place, maybe with a warm beverage. Or cold beverage.. it must be starting to turn spring in the northern hemisphere by now! I think this might be the first year ever in my life that I’ve missed a spring. That’s kinda weird to think about.

The first moai we saw. A moai has four parts: the platform upon which it stands (the “Ahu”), the body/torso typically made out of tuff, a top knot, and eyes made out of coral. There are very few moai that have all of its parts together today.

</figcaption>

Easter Island (or Rapa Nui as the indigenous people call it) was initially a bit of a stretch goal for us. It's a five hour flight from Santiago and we didn't know much about the island besides that it was a small island out in the far Pacific known for big stone heads. After talking to some folks on the O trek who very enthusiastically recommended traveling to Rapa Nui (and recommended skipping some time in Santiago to compensate), we decided to go. We had another moment of doubt though when we found out that after COVID (or “pandemia” as it is called in South America) Rapa Nui started requiring a guide to visit all the moai in the national park. The rationale for this new requirement is multifaceted (in my opinion): we heard that it was partially because visitors had been coming and touching the moai which caused additional damage to the moai (many are already being worn away by the salt and wind from the island as well as a white coloured fungus) and also that it was a way for more of the Rapa Nui residents to be able to earn money (more on that at the end of this post). Initially, this was a bit of a bummer for us because we tend to enjoy being able to see sights on our own schedule and we had gotten recommendations to rent a car and drive around the island to see all the different moais (there are about 1000 moais that were carved but only half that made it out of the quarry where they were carved). Having now visited Rapa Nui with a guide for two days, I would say that everyone who visits the island _must_ go with a guide even if one day they change the rules.

This is a good example of a moai that has been slowly affected by the white fungus and also wind and salt erosion. Many of the moai are near the coast, facing inward, so are on the frontlines of the sea’s wrath.

</figcaption>

In any case, we finally decided on spending 5 full days on the island with a travel day on either end. Traveling to Rapa Nui is pretty interesting: these days there is exactly one flight to the island and one flight out of the island. The plane used: a magnificent 787. I found it somewhat hilarious that this humongous plane had to land and take-off from the single runway that literally spanned the entire length of the island. It was an open-air airport where you’d just stroll onto the tarmac to board the flight.

Rapa Nui has a fascinating history and we did our best to try to learn as much about the history of the island, its people, and its culture both before we landed and even in our first days on the island. Rapa Nui has a bit of a mysterious air to it because of several reasons. One big one is that its culture is based on oral history. That makes it quite difficult because there was a period of time where the population of Rapa Nui had diminished to just around 100 people. They did have writing for a short period of time called the “rongo rongo” script, but learning to write was reserved for a very small population of people (a special group of academics, you could call it) and there are no more people left who have any knowledge about the script (and the few preserved barks with the script have not been translated yet).

<figcaption>

Petroglyphs on red scoria. Some of the symbols look similar to rongo rongo (in my eyes) but they are two very distinct things.

</figcaption>

Another reason is the moai themselves — at one point in time every single moai on the island was toppled over. The standing moai that we now see today have been re-raised by conservation efforts. It’s an ongoing conversation about how many of the moai to re-raise versus leave in their fallen state as the fallen state reflects the history of the island. The oral history says that the moai were toppled over because of tribal wars, but the podcast we listened to said that there hasn’t been much archeological evidence uncovered that proved that there were extensive tribal wars. Instead it theorized that the Rapa Nui people had lost faith in the moai that were supposed to protect the people after Europeans had repeatedly brought destruction to the land, either via direct violence or through disease. After seeing the standing moai, I couldn’t help but feel almost sad for the moai that had been pushed over face down. It made me wonder about what their faces looked like and who they represented. Moai were built for kings, chiefs, and priests when they passed away.

Moais that have been pushed over facedown. I found this scene to be heartbreaking.

The Rapa Nui people were once a flourishing group of people with a population of over 10,000 (the exact number really varies based on who you ask). The destruction of their people through European introduced diseases, the Peruvian slave trade, and their internal tribal wars have really made the people who consider themselves Rapa Nui today, very passionate about the preservation of their culture and their lands. For two days on the island, we had a wonderful guide named Zoe who not only took us (as part of a small group) to explore the moai, the lava caves and tubes that run through the island, but she talked about how much knowledge is passed down to her via her grandmother about the history of the land and its people, how to use and cultivate the natural resources of the island, and the efforts that she and her brother put in to teach her son and cousins about the secrets of the island. I really felt her passion come through. I’ll add several photos below with a few more tidbits of things we learned about the island.

<figcaption>

Lava caves/tubes were used for many purposes including for living and cultivating food. Entrances to lava caves/tubes can be found by searching for plants like this banana tree (or fig, avocado, and other fruit trees).

</figcaption>

The lava tubes are really cool and extend for miles and miles! We climbed out of this hole to pop out in a different part of the island.

These tiny islands next to Rapa Nui were used for a competition called the “Birdman” competition. Young men would compete to swim to the island, find an egg laid by a bird that migrates there, and be the first to bring it back. The winner would be responsible for decision making regarding the island’s resources for one year.

<figcaption>

Tons of moai on their way to their final destination, though they never made it. This photo was take from the quarry, Rano Raraku, where they were born. The oral songs say that they moai “walked” to their destination — the best way to think about this is imagine trying to rock a fridge back and forth to move it. It’s similar to that. I hope it’s true because the image of moai “walking” to their destination really cracks me up. What a sight that must have been!

Can you spot the nearly completed moai still in the quarry?

The vibe of Rapa Nui today is definitely very relaxed; it has similarities to Hawaii, but is definitely more rustic and less built out than Hawaii, which I personally really enjoyed. There are very few luxury hotels here (I think we passed one one evening when we strolled along the road for a sunset walk) but the people here are really friendly and the animals even friendlier. I’ve unlearned all my habits of trying to avoid strays; I both feed and pet random cats and dogs (hey, at least I’m not going around petting llamas and vicuñas… yet). We became quite attached to one cute pie stray dog who would whack his tail against our apartment door every morning and I’d feed him an extra roll that I snuck from breakfast. There was also a lovely cat who really seemed like a dog who wanted nothing more than to play with Kevin, who just happens to be allergic to cats. The cat would whine and whine until Kevin gave it something to chase, usually his hand.

One of the most spectacular things we did on the island was see the sunrise over Ahu Tongariki. An “Ahu” is the stone platform upon which the moais sit and Tongariki is the largest one that has been reconstructed with 15 moais. Only 1 moai has a top knot though, the others couldn’t be matched with their moais so they sit in a separate section from the platform. Watching the sun slowly brighten the skies before it makes its appearance over the sea horizon behind the moai is a pretty special experience. For me, it really gave me a sense of how impressive these moai were and I felt quite small standing next to the towering bodies and vast sea beyond.

I love it when there are clouds that light up juuuuust as the sun is about it make its appearance for the day.

For our remaining time on Rapa Nui, we went scuba diving (Kevin’s first time!) and did a short hike through the center of the island to its peak. Scuba diving was super fun and we definitely want to get our licenses to be able to do it on our own at some point, perhaps later in the year in Asia somewhere. The hike was also cool — you could see the three points of the island from the top (the island is shaped like a triangle) and we had some excellent homemade burritos for lunch. I’m pretty tired of sandwiches for lunch at this point :) Unfortunately we’re now out of hot sauce. Is this an emergency situation? Maybe. But at least I got my spicy fix through extra spicy pisco sours in Santiago. I’ve enjoyed seeing the concern on waiters’ faces when I too enthusiastically say “YES YES EXTRA SPICY POR FAVOR.”

From the highest point on the island — it’s not that high :) But we did enjoy hiking after many days!

And finally, for one last story of Rapa Nui — protesters shut down the airport on the day we were to fly out of the island. We were driven to the airport and our driver had to stop before the entrance as there were police vehicles blocking the road. We took our bags and got as close to the entrance as we could by foot as we couldn’t really tell what was going on. We still don’t quite know, but it looked like there were many Rapa Nui natives who were gathered at the airport entrance in a standoff with the Chilean security forces. We did some online research and our understanding is that Rapa Nui and the Chilean government have had a history of tension and clashes in the past. For two years during “pandemia” there were no flights to or from Rapa Nui which meant that the native people started to relearn their ways of living solely on the island with the island’s natural resources without tourism dollars. There’s always been a bit of tension between Chileans who want to come to Rapa Nui to stay for extended periods while the Rapa Nui people are trying to preserve their way of life. There’s also tension between the portion of money that Chile takes from tourism to benefit the “continents” (their word for the mainland) versus the island itself. So some part of that (or perhaps something completely unrelated) may have been the cause of the protests. The protests did dissipate enough that the airport reopened and we flew back to Santiago. It certainly gave a lot to think about, as did our entire experience on Rapa Nui. The tension between the pros and cons of tourist dollars, the distribution of that wealth between a parent country and what once was a flourishing self-sustaining land, and the never ending question of how far to take “conservation” to restore but also represent a land’s history, both the good and the bad.

Also, the Rapa Nui people are looking to get one of their moai back named “Stolen Friend.” It’s in the British Museum.

**Things we loved**:

1. Even if you don’t have any interest in going to Rapa Nui one day, I still strongly recommend listening to the Fall of Civilizations podcast, the Easter Island episode. I found it very good about trying to use archeological evidence instead of European reports about the island’s history. I would say that the Rapa Nui people today place a bit more weight on the songs that have passed through generations, but there were lots of aspects of the history that aligned well between the podcast and what we learned at the little museum on the island.

2. [The museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/auJfBq1uDLMAa3fJ8?g_st=ic) on the island is a must-do, ideally as one of the first things you do on the island. It takes only about 45 minutes to read everything, but it teaches you a lot about the Rapa Nui history which provides much needed context for visiting the moai and the Rapa Nui historical structures throughout the island.

3. [Ovahe beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HpLcWsbQs2xUrhPt9?g_st=ic): the Anakena beach which is right next door is much more popular and has more facilities, but we loved this little cove for an afternoon swim. There were very few people here (there are no facilities whatsoever), but the water is very warm, shallow and calm. We were told to go in the morning but honestly, we liked the afternoon better because it meant that the cove was in the shadow of the towering red scoria cliffs and we could be a little more loosely goosey about sunscreen application.

4. [Rapa Nui Dream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y3J3S9idxAL3wdD7A?g_st=ic): this tour agency was fantastic and we really enjoyed our 2.5 days with them. Zoe was phenomenal and we loved spending two days with her.

5. [Ahu Tahai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vbx2rjuNbQcfXCGd6?g_st=ic): a wonderful place to see sunsets. We didn’t manage to see one (the sun disappeared early behind clouds), but it was a lovely open spot anyways with dogs and children running around everywhere dodging the tripods set up by folks hoping to timelapse the sunset behind the moais.

6. [Au Bout Du Monde](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mTu9V6h3BD4iWFrJ6?g_st=ic): a wonderful French-Chilean-ish restaurant that had a limited menu but was so so delicious.
