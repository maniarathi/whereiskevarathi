Hang onto your watermelons; this one is another long post! I thought about whether to break this up into two posts, but decided to just go for one. I couldn’t quite figure out how to break it up in a logical way. Perhaps it’s a nice read with a glass of lemonade or iced tea to contrast the winteriness of South Africa! Apologies in advance for any writing mistakes; I didn’t quite have the time to go back and do an edit pass but perhaps I will one day. For now, it’s a mad dash to catch up on all of our Africa travels!

One aspect of traveling for an extended period of time that I didn’t expect was how much Kevin and I would use the seasons and weather patterns to help determine where to go next or when to move on to a new place. We started in February at the southernmost city in the world and made our way north, trying to escape the incoming winter. As fall turned into winter, we hopped back to the northern hemisphere to enjoy the last of spring and early days of summer, traveling westwards. Then the weather got too hot again (my skin broke out into heat rashes towards the end of Turkey) and we decided to jump back down into the southern hemisphere into Africa where it is now peak winter, but more mild than South America since we aren’t quite as far south.

We saw tons of bottlenose dolphins in Port Elizabeth as well.

We might have overcompensated; South Africa was cold! We got off the plane in Johannesburg and got surprised by the chill, perhaps accentuated by the recent 40+ degree weather in Turkey. After spending the night in Johannesburg, we continued flying onwards to Port Elizabeth. This was Kevin’s third time (my second time) in South Africa and during Kevin’s first trip, he did a tour of the South African coastline from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth. We decided to continue where he left up and try to head up “The Wild Coast” towards Durban. Unfortunately, the cold temperatures made us reroute our plans. The Wild Coast is known for its beautiful untouched beaches but given the temperatures, I don’t think we would have enjoyed it as much as we would during the summertime. We did do some pretty fun things in Port Elizabeth though, including getting to see whales! I’ve joked before that I seem to have a whale curse; I’ve never seen a whale before in my life _even_ after going on a specific whale watching tour. With a strong dose of skepticism (only from my end), we signed ourselves up for another whale watching tour from Port Elizabeth. The humpback whales this time of year are migrating northward to have their babies.

I broke my curse! We saw so many whales! And they are huge! We saw around six whales that were quite close to the boat where we could see their bodies but we saw dozens more out at sea, the locations disclosed by their forceful Old Faithful-esque exhalations through their blowholes (fun fact: I learned that whales just release moist air through their blowholes but upon immediate contact with air, it condense, making it appear as though whales blow water out). Besides whales, we also saw probably the largest pod of bottlenose dolphins that I’ve ever seen in my life, a few penguins on a little island that used to be jam packed with penguins (the population declined partially due to oil spills), as well as some albatross soaring through the air with their insane wingspan. The company that organized the tour was very cool; they originally started out as a conservation group and would solicit funding through other companies in Port Elizabeth, but as their polemics began to call out those very same companies on their questionable practices, including lapses that led to many oil spills in the area, their funding got pulled. So they decided to run their own tour company on the side to be able to fund themselves and speak out freely which seems to have worked out pretty well.

One other cool thing we did in Port Elizabeth was visit the Addo Elephant Park. We drove ourselves to the park, which was some good practice driving on the left hand side, which we made extra challenging for ourselves by renting a manual. I have driven a left hand manual very briefly in Ireland many many years ago, but this definitely was the most substantial amount of left hand manual I’ve ever driven. I think it at least helped avoid turning on the windshield wipers when I meant to flip the turn signal because I glued my left hand to the stick and kept my right hand on the wheel which forced me to correctly use my right hand for the turn signals. We both slipped a few times anyways which always cracks me up as the windshield wiper dutifully wipes away at nothing.

As the park name suggests, we saw lots of elephants! My favorite was seeing baby elephants which were always sandwiched by the adult female elephants in their herd. I find it hilarious to watch baby elephants swing their trunks around, seemingly unsure of what to do with it. Occasionally trying to drink water and then dribbling it all over the place. We also saw lots of zebras, warthogs (which everyone just calls “Pumbas”), kudus, and prairie dogs. Our safari was pretty short, just a couple hours, so it got us excited for our upcoming more extensive safaris through the Serengeti and Masai Mara.

We didn’t end up doing too much more in Port Elizabeth and spent nearly two days glued to our screens trying to do a bit more planning. Different than South America or Europe, it’s a little harder to show up without a plan in Africa, especially for safaris. It’s also not as easy to just simply rent a car and travel around if you don’t have loads of time because distances are huge. This last point bit us a little. Our original plan was to drive up the coast eastwards and northwards from Port Elizabeth but because peak winter is actually quite cold (colder than we expected), we thought we’d skip the beaches and hit some more of the hiking and city scene. Turns out, driving to those areas would take us a very long time so after a few days in Port Elizabeth, we got right back on a plane back to Johannesburg to instead begin a road trip through the northeastern part of South Africa and briefly into Lesotho.

We picked up a car from the Johannesburg airport and started to make our way towards a small town called Clarens which is the gateway for Golden Gate Highlands National Park. Probably around halfway towards Clarens, we realized that it was starting to smell quite smokey and the air progressively was getting thicker and thicker. IQAir was not particularly helpful unfortunately; it was showing clean air in the Clarens area and a few areas in the outskirts of Johannesburg that had poor air quality due to industrial activity which we did see as well. Our well-trained noses from Northern California fires definitely were setting off forest fire alarms. We saw a few bush fires that looked intentional in some of the tiny villages that we passed and once we reached our cabin, we asked our host who knew nothing about the fires. After settling into our cabin, we went out to the one grocery store in town to grab supplies for dinner and right at the horizon was a blazing orange line of fire. There were fires just at the city’s edge. We got a hilariously dry note from our host who said “the fires are bad.” No kidding! It looks like they’re about to encroach on the village! Unfortunately, it was also really windy so we heard that it was quite difficult to contain the fire and that many of the farmers were pitching in to help fight the fires all night.

We weren’t sure if we were going to be able to but we cautiously ventured out to the Golden Gate Highlands the following day. Miraculously, the smoke was clear of the national park area and was largely just settled between the city and the national park. We drove through the area and could see scorched land for quite some distance and some of the fires still burning away. The weather was still a bit rough though; it was quite cold with winds gusting around 50 kilometers an hour. When we showed up to the national park visitors center to purchase our day permits, she looked at us in complete disbelief and said “are you sure?! You want to hike in this weather?!”

I’m really glad we went hiking. Instead of doing a longer loop, we chose to do a few short hikes in a starburst pattern so that we could bail at any point in time and head back to the car. The Golden Gate Highlands definitely earned their “Golden” adjective; especially in the peak winter with less water, the whole area was a burnished gold color that would glow when the sun would briefly peek out from the racing clouds.We only saw two other people during our entire time hiking. Aside from the short hikes, the park also had two driving loops that we were welcome after getting bullied by the wind. We got some unbelievably gorgeous views of the next-door Drakensberg Park and some wildebeest that were hurtling around in the wind. The wildebeest were so expected; we could barely believe it but the binoculars confirmed that it was so and we had a great time watching them running around as a herd in the wind. A little preview of Serengeti, I guess!

After we finished our two driving loops, we started to head back towards Clarens for the night. Back at the entrance of the park, there was a traffic officer who waved us down. He told us that there had been an accident earlier in the day with two vehicles because the smoke was so thick. I think he was trying to discourage us from driving back to Clarens. We asked him a few questions about whether there was an alternative route or if the road was actually fully closed and what he would advise. He was pretty vague about all the answers so eventually we asked if it would be alright if we drove back and were careful to drive slowly. His cheerful response: “I dunno; maybe it’s your time to die!” So with that blessing in hand, we trundled onwards directly back to Clarens. The smoke did get pretty thick briefly but everything ended up being fine.

It got cold that night. We had a little wood burning stove in our cabin that was providing the main heating and we went through two full bundles of wood that night. It dropped down to below zero Celsius and the cabin was not very well insulated so we went to bed pretty early as well. The cabin was really cute, with board games and a pretty nice collection of coffee table books, but we were huddled around the fire most of the time, or gripping hot bowls of soup or tea or in the hot shower or in bed so didn’t get to enjoy it as much as we might have another time. It was just a short cold snap though; we were lucky that the next few days were warming back up to more normal wintertime temperatures. Still cold, but not so cold that I was too ruefully missing the ski jacket that I shipped back to the States.

The weather improved a lot the next day, just in time for us to do a beautiful and famous “chains” hike called the Amphitheater. It’s a relatively easy hike that follows a ridge on the Drakensberg mountains until you get to one of two choice to climb up to the plateau where the hike finishes: either you can go up a steep, loose rock gorge or you can climb a long set of chain ladders to go straight up. To get to the trailhead is also an adventure; you need a 4x4 to traverse what I could only describe as a very rough attempt to make a straight path to the trail head in the mountain. We caught a shuttle provided by the hotel that is situated right next to the beginning of the 4x4 road and the pickup truck swung back and forth over some serious rock piles and potholes. Occasionally the potholes were so deep that someone had chucked a few bricks into it to make it a bit more “level.” I think this ride might have surpassed even Bolivia in bumpiness.

We opted for the chains. We peeked at the gorge on the way there and the warnings were not undeserved; it was _steep_ and the baseball to basketball sized rocks were _loose_. We hadn’t seen the chains yet so we figured perhaps it would be easier to go down the gorge and do the hike as a loop while we went up the chains. So onwards we trekked towards the chains! There were a couple spots on this hike that had my heart racing when the trail disappeared and required a big step to avoid slipping off the ledge and I was squatted down for a few moments while I gathered my fleeing wits and hugged the rock wall to get over. Those couple moments were honestly scarier than the chains themselves. Though I will say, the chains up a sheer cliff were quite something! I don’t think I’ve ever done a hike quite like that before!

![](assets/img/south-africa/P7090023_Original.jpeg)

The top of the chains is remarkably flat! It feels like you’re on a vast plains area it was a cool tracing the tiny frozen river to the edge on the other side. The “tallest” waterfalls in the world drops off the edge, though a) this time of year, there is no water and b) apparently whether this is truly the tallest waterfall is controversial. The views from the top are absolutely stunning and we got some beautiful views of Royal Natal and Drakensberg parks. The Amphitheater itself is expansive and beautifully red-orange. It was quite windy the whole way, but it felt like it picked up a bit as we got to the top so we ate our packed lunch and started to head back down. Because of the wind, we decided against going down the gorge and went back to the chains. The gorge wasn’t the easiest to find; we had a couple other groups ask us for help to find the gorge which we were able to help out with since we had AllTrails running.

It was windy coming back down!

One weird thing about doing this hike is that you have to book the shuttles for a particular time. I wasn’t sure whether they would be strict about what time you could get on the shuttle, say if you happened to hike faster or slower than predicted (this happened to me in Spain and I ended up having to wait for my scheduled shuttle) so we were trying to make it back in time for our 5pm shuttle. Since the way down was, well, going down, we ended up picking up our pace a bit. And the wind! The wind was really going by then. We ended up about an hour early and chilled at a small hut that was stationed at the trailhead. There was another group of four hikers, the last on the mountain (everyone has to check in and out in a guestbook), that were also coming down though we had earlier directed them to the gorge and so were taking a bit longer. The wind _howled_ as the minutes went on and I think every aspect of the hut was shaking. They arrived safely, not too long later, and we all crammed into another 4x4 to get jostled back to the hotel. The group of four young adults were exchange students from Switzerland, studying law and studying abroad in Pretoria. The 4x4 barely made it back; just as we got to the bit of paved road the engine of the car died and we coasted to the entrance. The car had definitely seen better days; at one point the door refused to stay closed as well. But it did the job!

Following our adventure hike, we embarked on something that neither of us have ever done before: an overnight horseback riding “trek.” I had studied a bit of horseback riding in undergrad but Kevin hasn’t done too much beyond the odd vacation every now and again. I threw him off into the deep end! We had two fantastic guides who taught us to trot and canter and we rode a total of around ten hours over the two days. Our legs and asses were definitely in pain by the end of the first day of riding six hours but my goodness, what an amazing way to explore Drakensberg! I was incredibly impressed at the type of terrain, including steep, rocky brush, that the horses could go up and every so often, our guide would point out to where we had been and I’d be amazed at how much we could traverse quickly by horseback. The horses were very well behaved, except occasionally the gorgeous grey stallion that our main guide was riding. We learned that the stallion was a loan from a nearby farm for breeding purposes and this was his first “trek” so with that knowledge, I was very impressed by how well he did.

![](assets/img/south-africa/PXL_20240710_134159375_Original.jpeg)

When we arrived at our lodge for the night, the horses of the lodge had been shooed out of their stables and out in a field area. I’ll never forget how all the lodge horses piled up against the gate watching our horses get priority in the stables. They just stood there watching as our horses’ saddles were taken off and all four of our horses immediately dropped to the ground and started rolling around in the grass like dogs. They slurped water, mine had a particular love of stopping at every water source on the trail and dribbling out half of the water with every gulp, and noshed on something in a big trough. And the other horses continued to watch on. I can only imagine the incredulity they probably were thinking: who are these strange horses that are now rolling around in my house that I got kicked out of?!

<figcaption>

Dinner at the lodge! I remember that the side of carrots and zucchini (called “baby marrow” in South Africa) was so so good and buttery. It probably had a naughty amount of butter in it and it was delightful.

</figcaption>

We had a really lovely evening at this lodge. We weren’t expecting much as we had no idea what lodging had been booked for us, but we had a delicious three-course candlelight dinner next to a blazing fire. I unsuccessfully tried to make a fire in our room but instead filled it with smoke. As I left the windows open and curled up into bed, Kevin went out for a quick peek outside to gaze up into the stars. As he seems to do in every country now, the lodge’s cat immediately found him and cuddled his legs… and then leaped through the open window into bed with me. Oops! We shooed him out eventually, panicking as our host told us we weren’t supposed to let the cats in.

The cat once again found her favorite human, Kevin, in the morning.

The horses really can crush through incredibly steep terrain. On the first day, there was one bit that was so steep that the horses were panting a bit by the time we reached the top plateau, but I could barely believe we rode up the steep loose rocky hill on horseback in the first place while I was clinging on for dear life. The second day, we clambered up another hill but this time, it was steep enough that we left the horses part of the way up and climbed up on our own two feet. Up on the plateau, we peered over the ledge to view a vulture nesting area and fill our eyes with more incredible views of landscape. After a long stint of riding, my legs felt so wobbly that I felt like an infant learning how to toddle their first steps.

We returned to our horses and continued towards the last bit of our “trek” which was to check out some old bushman paintings. The drawings were actually in pretty reasonable condition and clear enough that we could figure out some of the depictions on our own, primarily of hunting animals. The bushmen still live in South Africa as well as other bordering countries though I believe their nomadic way of life is getting harder to maintain. Our guides mentioned that they are trying to preserve their culture and language and starting to get more support from the government to be able to teach their language in schools.

We returned back to the stables in the afternoon and had a bit of an adventure getting out of the remote lodge. We were running late on the day that we started our horseback riding so we continued driving towards the lodge even though our fuel gauge was indicating that we imminently needed to refuel. We were watching our remaining kilometers and cross checking against the remaining kilometers to the stables as we drove but didn’t anticipate the rolling hills depleting our gas faster than anticipated. So here we were, now out in the middle of nowhere, with the nearest gas station a bit more than thirty kilometers away! We gambled because on the way to the stables, the hills were more uphill so armed with the knowledge, we stared down our remaining kilometers as I drove as efficiently as I could, down to the gas station. Phew! We made it! Actually, I think we ended up being more than fine because oddly, the remaining kilometers kept going _up_ as time went on which really should have indicated that the whole thing was bogus but sometimes, one just needs a bit of reassurance.

Then we went skiing. For just the hell of it, we decided to pay a visit to AfriSki in Lesotho. Kevin, on one of his previous South Africa visits, met someone who was traveling for an extended period of time and had a goal to ski on every continent and told Kevin about AfriSki which is one of two places in the entire continent of Africa that one can ski. This is one of those things that having time definitely allowed us the luxury of checking out because let’s be honest, Africa is not usually the place people think about for a ski holiday. But the sheer hilarity of the idea of skiing in Africa compelled us both so we decided to make it a plan and so we set out! It was a good thing we got experience driving in South Africa because as soon as we crossed the border into Lesotho, the driving got more adventurous. Deep, deep potholes everywhere! Driving was increasingly more like a video game: the idea is to mostly stick to driving on the left and swerve when you see a pothole or a car that’s coming straight at you in the opposite direction. Oh and also avoid hitting the people walking in the street (although the people of South Africa have an, arguably life saving, sense of personal responsibility to stay alive, not the car’s responsibility). One particularly memorable part of the drive was going up a hill with a construction vehicle blocking most of the road and multiple construction workers guiding me to squeeze to the right of the vehicle to get by while making sure, you know, my car wheels stayed on the tarmac. I made Kevin play the Lion King soundtrack (the original!) on the drive and so as I dodged the obstacle course, I appropriately belted out Hakuna Matata.

![](assets/img/south-africa/PXL_20240712_134641023_Original.jpeg)

Both of us were cracking up as we saw the single rectangle of man-made snow on a hill emerge as we rounded the final corner of the drive. We had a great time though! We went up that single toe rope over and over again while we bombed down the single run. I think once, just for variety, we skied into the bunny slope hill. For a few hours of the day, Kevin could easily claim the title of being the best skier on the mountain until a few kids showed up towards the end of the day who were seriously talented. We found enjoyment in both the skiing itself, seriously, what a crazy thing to do in the middle of _Africa_, and in people watching while we ate a late lunch as folks pizza-ed their way down the run. This was my only skiing of the entire season and I still can’t believe it was in Africa.

After AfriSki, we headed back to Johannesburg for a couple days of getting errands done and planning. The remainder of our time in Africa is going to be in malaria risk areas so we stocked up on nearly 100 anti-malaria pills from the “Dis-Chem,” the popular pharmacy. We’re going to have to each take one a day until we are free of the malaria-risk regions plus another seven days. They handed us 150 dollars worth of pills in a locked cage that had to be unlocked by a special key that the cashier had.

There was a huge mall-like area called Nelson Mandela Square that was within walking distance from our Airbnb. We were situated a bit away from more central Johannesburg, but in a safe area where it was ok to walk around at night, at least short distances. I think it was a rather strange thing to do, to walk the fifteen minutes to the mall, and most people travel by car or taxi/Uber. The Square was very helpful for us to get lots of errands done in one place like get the medication, get some camera accessories, and also eat at some lovely restaurants.

Nelson Mandela Square.

</figcaption>

On our last day, we managed to escape from our Airbnb and Nelson Mandela Square to do one touristy thing in Johannesburg that Kevin also hadn’t previously done, which was to visit Constitution Hill where both Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi were once imprisoned. The jail held many political activists who opposed apartheid. I surprised myself by nearly tearing up during the tour; I was happy I was wearing sunglasses. To better understand the treatment that Africans and coloured people went through in such detail, presented so stolidly by our guide, to view videos of the women who are still alive today who were once jailed in conditions so bad that eventually the prison closed down for overcrowding and neglect… it’s moving. I was especially moved by the decision to place the Constitutional Court (South Africa’s Supreme Court equivalent) on the grounds of the former prison, a place where, as our guide said, the judges are reminded every day of the former violations of human rights while they today work to protect human rights.

The entrance to the Constitutional Court is written out in all of South Africa’s 11 official languages.

</figcaption>

In the Constitutional Court building, our guide told us a little bit about how the government works. South Africa has a 12 year term limit for judges. What a novel idea, that, eh? He also mentioned that judges are kicked out at the age of 70: “we give them cake and then say bye bye.” Kevin and I did our hardest not to look at each other during the entire presentation but as soon as we got outside, one look and we were both doubled over laughing. How progressive.

Nelson Mandela wasn’t jailed in the same location as the other prisoners; he was actually imprisoned in the prison’s hospital because the guards were worried that he would be too influential on any prison mates. We watched a video of Nelson Mandela coming back to the very place he was once jailed to sign a copy of the South African Bill of Rights. Among the rights listed: “Everyone has the right to bodily and psychological integrity, which includes the right to make decisions concerning reproduction” and “Everyone has the right to have access to health care services, including reproductive health care.“ My jaw dropped. Again, what a novel idea, eh? It’s worth skimming the [South African Bill of Rights](https://www.justice.gov.za/constitution/chp02.html) to jolt ourselves into reminding what basic rights should look like. To be fair, I suppose there is a 200+ year difference in when the US versus South African bill of rights was written but still.

South Africa obviously still has a lot of things still not right. Kevin and I remarked that every place we stayed at in South Africa was owned by a white person including vast areas of land where we went horseback riding. There are still vast villages that are terribly poor, with housing made of corrugated steel, which was one of the cheap materials given to black people when they were displaced from their homes and driven out to the outskirts of town. But I thought about something I once heard Trevor Noah say about his upbringing in South Africa; he remarked that the difference between how the US treats slavery and South Africa treats apartheid is that South Africans are not afraid to _talk_ about apartheid and remember how awful it was. And that means a conversation can begin to try to fix the wrongs instead of pretending an atrocity never happened. That seems like a good thing. My visit to Constitution Hill inspired me to read _Beloved_, by Toni Morrison to go back and remember our own country’s history. I cannot recommend the book enough.

We’d love to come back to South Africa, yep again, one day. We still need to finish off the Wild Coast and I would love to see more of Johannesburg and the Garden Route. But for now, we decided to head northwards to Mozambique! See you there!
