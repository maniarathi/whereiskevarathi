\*\*\* Note for email readers: I experimented with adding a “gallery” feature to this blog post and I have no idea how it will show up in email but I’m going to guess: bad. I would recommend reading this in a browser because I added lots of pictures :)

I feel like in the past several blog posts, I've been beginning by saying "ah, I'm so late for this blog post." Well, I'm sitting in our apartment in New York City, which we've called home for the last week, and realizing that I'm three blog posts behind and about to depart for Kazakhstan tomorrow. Oops! My excuse this time is that the end of our time in Africa was a whirlwind as we did three safaris in a row (one in Tanzania, one in Kenya, and one in Uganda) and then had another whirlwind time in North America, attending a wedding and visiting family. We initially thought we'd head out of NYC yesterday but ended up extending another two nights so that we could get some more planning done and also do errands like laundry. We actually just got back from trying to get an international driving permit to be able to drive in Kazakhstan but struck out because we have Canadian licenses. Having a license from a different country than our passports has given us more trouble than we thought; I remember nearly being denied a rental car from _Hertz_ in Argentina, because of this situation. It's not quite the problem now; the problem is simply that American AAAs don't process Canadian licenses for the IDP. We'll have to probably hire a driver or do more guided tours as a result, but that's ok.

So, going way back. After Zanzibar, we headed to Arusha where we started our first of three safaris. This one was seven days and traversed primarily through the Serengeti with stops at Tarangire National Park, the Ngorongoro Crater, and Lake Manyara National Park. We decided to go with a private safari that had all the stops we wanted and we had two wonderful guides, Emanuelle and his trainee Dominick who treated us to the most amazing wildlife sightings for the following six days (the first day was mostly a travel day... plus a weird stop at a humongous souvenir store that was totally empty, yet filled to the brim with all sorts of tchotchkes... do they actually sell everything?!). After landing in Arusha, we walked straight off the plane onto the tarmac, through a lightweight door and spilled onto the parking lot surrounding some splintered picnic tables where the ground staff chucked our bags directly from the belly of the plane. Ahhh, I missed this. Back in Toronto when I was working on my pilot's license, I loved being able to walk right through the back door of the school directly onto the tarmac to my plane sitting right at the edge of Lake Ontario. Don't worry, the back door was password protected!

We grabbed our bags from the ramshackle bench and headed to our hotel to spend the night relaxing. Per what seems to be the custom in African countries, we were served cold juices as a refreshment when we arrived at the hotel. You might be wondering at this point, how strange of her to mention a random welcome drink at a random hotel when many welcome drinks must have been drunk over the last seven months! Well, this welcome drink took over my life for the following five days. Approximately thirty minutes after the drink was drunk and we had settled into our hotel and I started hand washing a few items of laundry, my stomach was. in. pain. At first I didn't really think much of it since cramping is just a normal part of a woman's existence. But by the time I had finished setting out the laundry to dry, I was flat out on the bathroom floor, heaving up everything and maybe now is a good time to stop with the additional gory details. In the middle of the pain, I was absolutely bewildered; I was running through everything I had eaten in the last days to try to figure out what was going on, but nothing really stuck out as a possibility for food poisoning. For the rest of the night, I felt slightly better but still unwell, slightly nervous about going out into the middle of savannah near absolutely nothing except lions' dens for next six days.

The following morning, I felt somewhat better though there were still some lingering food poison-y symptoms. Down at breakfast, I went over to the juice station and saw the green juice again and below, it was labeled. Avocado Juice. Oh my gosh. The previous day I had downed a tall glass of avocado juice. I didn't even know avocado juice was a thing! No wonder I was sick (I am allergic to avocados... yes very weird)! Here's the dumb thing I did though; I thought, oh, tropical juice seems like it should be fine. I took a big ol' glass of tropical juice and started drinking it while explaining to Kevin what had happened and he said "umm, is it possible that 'tropical juice' is just a mix of the avocado juice and mango juice that's also sitting on the table?" I was close to smashing the glass with how hard I put that juice down. Oops. Again. Kevin was dead on correct. A short while later, while in the midst of an _incredible_ experience of doing a walking safari in the middle of Tarangire National Park, I had to ask our guide whether it might be ok for me to vomit behind some bushes. He said yes, but I think he knew, he didn't have a choice.

</figcaption>

Moving on from my stomach problems which continued to plague me throughout the safari (if you really want to know more gory details, ask me later for an exceptional story about a bout that came on as we were watching a huge herd of wildebeests were crossing a stream right in front of us, which shall not be written about in public as I am acutely aware that former coworkers occasionally read this blog and I might need to ask them for a reference in about four months and this story might ruin their impressions of my professionalism forever... hi!), the walking safari was something really special. We were on foot in the savannah, guided by a young ranger with a rifle, and we got to see a hyena dashing around, some zebras, giraffes, and elephants. I remember the first time we got close to a lion in Botswana  where we did our first safari and the jolt of both fear and excitement that I had, getting far closer than I thought would be a) possible or b) safe. I had a similar jolt here. Being on foot means that we aren't allowed to get as close to the animals (when you're in a car, the animals essentially think of you as part of the car entity which they view as a weird moving inanimate object and so leave unbothered) as we are now part of the living ecosystem and need to respect their senses of safety but we got close enough that not having a barrier between me and the wild animal felt a bit terrifying and amazing at the same time. For the most part, if we got too close, the animals would walk away, but occasionally we were just at the right distance where a zebra would look me dead in the eye, sort of curiously, before continuing on with its life. Which mostly involved eating. My favorite part was crouching behind some bushes towards the end of the walking safari, watching elephants eat while a few safari vehicles passed by to also check them out. I don't think the elephants even noticed us but I could have watched those animals for hours. What magnificent creatures!

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images %}

The following three days were spent roaming around in the Serengeti, mostly in the central and northern regions. The word "Serengeti" means "endless plains" and with the National Park spanning an area of around 14,000 square kilometers, the name is well deserved. A safari day usually starts early in the morning (actually, if my stomach had been less of a disaster, we would have asked to start earlier around 6am instead of 8am because the crepuscular animals like lions are much more active as dawn breaks and the lighting for photography is absolutely incredible). We would pack up our bags (we've now gotten our packing time down to about fifteen minutes) and head out after breakfast. Most of the hours in the day are spent in the vehicle being rocked and jostled and bumped around by the washboard roads. Emanuelle had a radio going where safari drivers would communicate to each other about various animal sightings that they had seen. A few times a day, we would quickly (well, as quick as the roads would allow) drive over to a sighting, especially to try to see somethings as elusive as lions or cheetahs or rhinos. Many other times, we would just drive around and see what we see. We were extremely lucky on this trip and saw what is called "the Big Five": elephants (common), lions (common), buffalos (common), leopards (elusive because they hide in the trees and are nocturnal), and rhinos (rare because they are endangered). We'd previously only seen the first three so we were really hoping for a leopard and/or rhino sighting and were extremely lucky to see both this time! I'll drop a bunch of photos of my favorite sightings from the Serengeti below (wait a bit for the rhino pic as we actually saw them in the Ngorongoro Crater and not the Serengeti). 

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images_2 %}

The leopard sighting was possibly one of my favorite experiences. Emanuelle, on his previous safari to the Serengeti, had found a particular rock with some trees where a leopard had called home and he drove us to the same rock on this trip, hoping that the leopard might be still around. Not only was she there, but her cub was peeking out as well! There wasn't a single other safari vehicle around and we watched the mama leopard and her cub lounging on the rock for about twenty or thirty minutes (I think... I lost track of time) until mama decided she needed a snack and with a big stretch, stalked off into the bushes where it seemed like she evaporated into thin air with her camouflage. With most of our other sightings, other vehicles will be around which can sometimes eat into the experience of being so near these amazing wild animals. Watching this mama and baby quietly for so long without another soul around was just so special.

We actually tried to time our visit to the Serengeti to catch the annual Great Migration where millions of wildebeests and zebras cross the treacherous Mara River from the northern part of the Serengeti over to Kenya, following the rain patterns to greener grasses. The Great Migration is the most massive land migration by total body weight. Why is the Mara River so treacherous? It's filled with crocodiles that love a good wildebeest snack. We had read that the best time to catch it might be in July or August so we aimed for the beginning of August. Seeing the Mara River crossing even on a good year is a crapshoot. We learned that wildebeests have terrible eyesight and so rely on the zebras to figure out when to cross, but even as they approach for crossing, any small thing moving in the river could spook them and they would turn back. Unfortunately, this year there were other elements at play; apparently both this year and the last couple of years, the rain patterns have been quite irregular which has caused the animals to cross much earlier than usual. While we were in the Serengeti, we saw what we thought were tons of wildebeest but Emanuelle said that it was quite low in numbers because the majority of them had already crossed. Also, unusually, the wildebeests crossed over a different river this year, the Sun River, instead of the usual Mara River. Luckily for the wildebeest, the Sun River has far fewer crocs so many of them had a safe and uneventful passage. In any case, we also learned that the majority of wildebeest who perish during the crossing each year actually die from their own stampede rather than the crocs. If the stampede is large enough, the crocs know to get out of there lest they too perish in the unremitting pounding of hooves. In addition to crossing early, there have been rains during what should be the dry season (we experienced this ourselves in Kenya later) and so some wildebeest have crossed in the opposite direction. Apparently, and unsurprisingly, climate change is speculated to be the cause of the variation in weather patterns so in the future, one's best bet to try to see the Mara River crossing is to try earlier in the year in early July.

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

In any case, we did see a small herd (again, to me, it seemed big) of some thousands of wildebeest peep over to the river and decide now to cross and run back. Watching the Mara River crossing is a massive waiting game; we only spent an afternoon waiting to potentially see the crossing, but other cars that were parked along the riverbank had been waiting since the morning. Early in the day, the wildebeest had almost crossed but a croc was spotted by the animals so they bailed. It was really quite an experience to be one of the cars among many (maybe up to one hundred?) trying to make a best guess as to when and where the wildebeest might cross. Emanuelle, with his two decades plus experience, guessed that they wouldn't cross that day and picked a location to watch the herd of wildebeest charge across the plains to a new location which was still very cool to watch. We got a prime seat for that at least!

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images_3 %}

On our last day in the Serengeti, we saw something that Emanuelle said is so rare that he sees it roughly every two years even with the number of safari trips he does every month. We were tracking down a lion and saw it sort of alert in the grass. As we watched, the lion started walking. Then jogging. At this point, Kevin and I were both thinking, oh wow, we've never seen a lion jog, that's cool! A second later, the lion is in an all out sprint and we hear squealing and we realized what was happening: it found food. Even as I write this and remember watching the chase, I can feel my heartrate quicken a little. It was something else to watch both the lion and warthog sprint through the grass at full speed, right behind our vehicle across the car path before the lion caught the warthog and suffocated the poor warthog until he was dead. Noooo, not Pumbaa!

</figcaption>

As the lion continued to suffocate the warthog (typically a lion will first kill their prey through suffocation before eating in contrast to other more savage animals like wild dogs that will eat their prey alive), we saw the most comical scene happening. A hyena apparently heard the commotion and we saw him slowly come out of the grass and start to lurk a little ways away from the lion. I was genuinely laughing as we watched the hyena sort of get near, then hide behind a tree, then approach a bit, then hide off

The lion knew the hyena's tricks and was out of there as soon as the warthog was dead. Bon appetit! 

</figcaption>

After three days in the Serengeti, we rattled our way over to a conservation area called Ngorongoro Crater. One thing of note: in Tanzania and neighboring countries, there is both the concept of a national park and also a conservation area. Historically, many humans have lived in the areas where wild animals roam, but in order to both protect the animals as well as foster tourism these two designations have been developed to balance it with supporting the traditional peoples' way of life. In a national park, no humans are allowed to live on the land. No poaching is allowed (punishable by life in prison) and humans cannot use the area for feeding their cattle. This is especially important because the primary tribe that lives in these areas are the Masai people and their livelihood is in husbandry. To create a national park, typically the government has relocated the people who originally lived on the land. In contrast, in conservation areas, there are radiuses set where humans are allowed to let their livestock graze the land and set up their villages. This allows the people to continue to live their ways of life and still maintain a radius of protection for some of the animals. The Masai people don't actually hunt or eat wild animals; they typically have only killed the animals when they threaten their livestock but this can happen very frequently if these boundaries haven't been set.

The Ngorongoro Crater is a volcano caldera (inactive) and contains a huge number of species because of the weather that keeps the vegetation lush and plentiful all year long. This was the place where we finally saw white rhinos. Emanuelle was keen on trying to make sure we got to see rhinos and our first sighting was from quite a distance that required binoculars to sort of make out the distinctive horn. He chuckled when Kevin said that we saw "the Big 4 and a half." Undeterred, a little while later, he found for us a set of three rhinos at a closer distance; close enough that I could capture one of them with my camera (pic below)! Kevin did upgrade us to seeing "the Big 5" after that.

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images_4 %}

We spent the first half of our last day on a game drive in the smallest national park in Tanzania called Lake Manyara. It's a really still, peaceful lake that actually has been getting larger as time passes. We could see that the game drive roads were very close to the edge of the water and Emanuelle said that they will probably need to create some new roads in the near future. We didn't see quite as many animals, but definitely enjoyed watching a large family of baboons and some more elephants before departing for Kilimanjaro International Airport.

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images_5 %}

But not to depart yet! We actually ended up spending a few more days in the vicinity of Kilimanjaro in a tiny town called Moshi before we left for Kenya. Moshi is one of the starting locations for folks who want to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and while we weren't climbing Kili (this time!), we wanted to do some hikes in the area. We picked up a car from Kili Airport, a car that had over two hundred thousand kilometers on it, and rattled it over to our cute hotel in a totally deserted resort. It was so weird! I think we were the only ones at the hotel that night with maybe two other sets of guests that showed up over the next couple of days. One was a couple that was spending the night before heading up Kili and we heard the very enthusiastic preparatory singing by their guides before they left that morning.

At this point, Kevin and I were hoping to be able to do some more self-guided exploration which is one of the reasons why we rented a car. It's actually surprisingly challenging to do self-guided exploration though. Renting a car involved me Whatsapp-ing some previous car rental contacts and hotels to see if anyone knew of anyone in the Arusha area that could rent us a car. Eventually we found one through a completely random number we found on Google Maps. It was surprisingly expensive too, even after negotiating down (everything must be negotiated in Africa so we've gotten decently good at it). We tried to do some self-guided hiking at a nearby waterfall called Materuni but were coerced into paying a small amount for a local guide. We sort of understand; when natural points of interest are turned into protected areas, and local people are displaced, the affected communities often struggle to sustain themselves financially, especially when government support is unreliable. The exchange was quite amusing though (in retrospect... in that moment, I was a little pissed off because I really wanted to just do a hike without a chaperone); the negotiation process for the guide fee involved the guy needing to "talk to their chief" to make sure the fee was ok. We actually were accosted about paying for a guide starting from the last five or so kilometers of the drive as two guys on a motorcycle rode alongside us while I was driving. It was a little exhausting but I suppose one gets used to it after some time.

Drinking banana beer with the local folks. Banana beer is actually not alcohol. Banana wine, which we bought one bottle of, is highly alcohol. As alcohol as actual wine. I can't say I took to either much.

</figcaption>

Finally, we visited one last park called Rau Forest which was super close to our hotel, nearing bordering, but it took us a good fifteen minutes to figure out how to get there because Google Maps either didn't know about roads or told us to go down non-existent roads. It was pretty useless, but Kevin got pretty good at figuring out the general direction to go and finding the most probable locations where we might be able to cross the river that separated us from the park entrance. Similarly to the waterfall hike, we got asked to pay for a guide, but this time we were prepared. Two ladies, a few years younger than us, accompanied us who were not too chatty but told us some interesting things about the land and its flora and fauna. Towards the end of our hike, one of the women started asking us a little about where we were from and what we did and we learned that the two of them were currently in university, working at Rau Forest over their break and had hopes of trying to break into the tourism industry and become park rangers/guides. It's an admirable and tough goal as we noticed that pretty much no women were safari guides and I can imagine that they have to stand up to substantial cultural pressures to make it. I hope they achieve their goals!

This is the oldest tree in the forest. We were told that for every orbit we walked around it, we would add one year to our life. I got one year back (figured I'd need an extra year back for all the second-hand smoke I inhaled in Paris). Kevin got three.

Did you make it all the way to the end of this blog post? Phew! That was a long one. Here's a recipe for you: toast half a bagel (if it's a NYC-sized bagel, otherwise, maybe you want both halves), excessively slather on za'atar spice and olive oil labneh (if you can't find it, make your own), then top with pine nuts that you've toasted with lots of olive oil and seasoned with salt, pepper and a dash of curry powder. Drizzle a bit of that seasoned olive oil on top if you're feeling extra. We ate this for breakfast for at least four of our days in NYC and it was possibly one of the best breakfasts we have made, ever.

Oh and if you're curious if this blog post was finished in New York City... it was not. We're now in Kazakhstan and in a half hour, I'm about to head out to go see some national teams play Kokpar where teams try to chuck a headless goat carcass into pits while on horseback. But that's for another day! Bye!
