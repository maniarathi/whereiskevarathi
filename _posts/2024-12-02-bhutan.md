Among the countries that we've visited to date, Bhutan was quite an unusual one. Bhutan is known for publicly saying that they prioritize their country's "gross national happiness" and prefer to have "high value, low impact" tourism which means that all tourists (except those with an Indian passport) are required to pay a steep daily tariff of one hundred dollars on top of daily fees that cover a guide, driver, food, accommodation, and sightseeing fees. Over the years, the visa price has varied between fifty to two-hundred fifty dollars per day with the government deciding that fifty dollars per day ended up with too many tourists and two-hundred fifty was too steep and curbed tourism too much. I don't know about any other country in the world that has this kind of tourism congestion pricing and it seems to be something the people of the country are proud of and also desire to keep long term. Because of this model of tourism, one thing that was sort of nice about planning for Bhutan is that the extent of planning on our end was very little; all we needed to do was message a few companies that are accredited by the Bhutan government for ten-day itineraries and pick which one we liked best. We decided to split our time in Bhutan into two parts: one part to visit more cultural aspects of the country and the other to do a trek in the Bhutanese Himalayas. It was nice to have a bit of a break from planning and be able to not worry about opening times of points of interest or where to eat or where to stay during our visit. Occasionally it's nice to have everything just sorted out, even though we both like to explore things on our own generally.

Tiger’s Nest Monastery, tucked into the mountains. It’s quite a steep trek to get here and both the inside and outside of the monastery are beautiful and intricately designed. Unfortunately we have no pictures from the inside of any monastery because it is not permitted to take photos inside any religious areas.

</figcaption>

The Bhutanese Himalayas were the real draw for us to spend some time in the country. I had also previously seen some pictures of the gorgeous Buddhist monasteries tucked away in the mountain nooks and crannies that I was also eager to see. The tricky thing about trekking in the Bhutanese Himalayas is that the window for clear weather is fairly small, either between October and November or in early spring; during this small window, one has a high chance of viewing the tips of the peaks that tower more than six or seven thousand meters. Other times of the year, the summits of those mountains are typically shrouded in cloud cover, as was true during my last visit to Nepal. However, those windows also pose a challenge because the temperature can be quite cold as it transitions to or from winter with chances of snowfall that can make hiking difficult. We originally wanted to do the Jomolhari trek that would take us to the base of Jomolhari mountain (which rises to 7300+ meters) but a few companies dissuaded us from doing the trek because it could start snowing in mid November which would shut down the mountain passes and force us to turn back. Ultimately we did the Druk Path trek instead of Jomolhari over five days and four nights. While the trek was overall quite easy for us, the nights were very cold, dropping around -5 to -10 degrees (celcius) and we didn't have very good quality sleeping bags (we had to borrow the company's) so sleeping was rough at night and because of that, I'm glad we didn't end up doing the Jomolhari trek since it would have been even colder. One day, I'd love to return to do the Jomolhari trek, this time with my own sleeping bag and better winter clothes. Bhutan has the highest mountains in the world that are still unclimbed because the Bhutanese believe that the summits are where the gods live and intruding on their homes would unleash bad things upon the country. That said, I found it hilarious that they don't bother to name any peaks that are in the six thousand meter range -- there are simply too many of them and aren't special enough to warrant a specific name! Seven thousands get names. Comparatively, the famed Kilimanjaro is not even six thousand meters!

We got a stunning view of Kangchenjunga above the clouds on the way out of Bhutan, flying from Paro to Kolkata. Kangchenjunga is the third tallest mountain in the world (after Everest and K2) and towers at more than 8500 meters.

</figcaption>

Flying to Bhutan is a special experience. We flew from Delhi to Paro which flies right over Everest but unfortunately it was cloudy so we didn't get a view. Our agency specially booked us seats on the left side of the plane which usually allows for a view if the weather is clear. Alas! We've resolved to hike Everest Base Camp sometime within the next few years so we'll have our chance to see her soon enough. Flying in the area in general is always a special experience: I remember my first flight over the Himalayas when I flew to Kathmandu and the pilot at that time also came on the intercom to let us know when we were flying over Everest. I don't think I saw it at that time either but I can't remember the reason why. Besides flying over the tallest mountains in the world, landing into Paro is quite the adventure. Apparently there are fewer than fifty pilots in the world that are trained to fly in and out of Paro as the city is tucked in a valley with tall mountains literally flanking all sides. This flight is the first time that a pilot has come on the intercom to warn passengers that if you look out the window, it will feel like we are very (read: too) close to the mountain tops but don't worry, that's just how you land into Paro. The circuit pattern to land is very similar to the one I learned in flight training but the difference is that you need to aim each leg of the circuit to cross over a saddle point in a mountain ridge line, each one progressively lower than the last until you drop the last of your altitude on the final leg. Each leg requires dropping significant amounts of altitude and each turn, after crossing the saddle point, is very sharp/steep. I also learned that Paro Airport operates with no radar so all the pilots land using VFR (visual flight rules) meaning that they are navigating using landmarks and their own visual assessment of the terrain. The runway is also shorter than normal so it was quite impressive to feel the pilot expertly and _gently_ set the bird down when they have to take into account a higher descent rate and not being able to see the runway until crossing the last mountain ridge and doing all this without any radar assistance. It's impressive flying. Our first couple nights in Paro were spent at a hotel that was nestled into the mountains right above one of the long ends of the runway so I had a great time watching flights land and take off.

We really started with a bang in Bhutan. Because our flight got delayed into Paro, we weren't able to visit the Paro Dzong (a "dzong" is a fortress) or the National Museum as planned after we arrived. Our guide Sangay and driver Jigme met us at the airport and took us for an evening coffee. We retired to our lodging pretty much right afterwards. However the next day, we squeezed in a hike to the famous Tiger's Nest Monastery, the museum, the fortress, a hot stone bath (very welcome after all the other activities) and a farmhouse dinner all in one day. The Tiger's Nest Monastery hike was easily the highlight of the day; the hike winds spectacularly through the mountains until you reach the last steep set of the stairs to the monastery which sits on the cliff like a port-a-ledge. Pretty much all the monasteries in Bhutan are active, even one as popular as Tiger's Nest which all the tourists visit, though I believe more of the rituals happen during the mornings and evenings when visitors aren't there. We have no pictures of the idols and murals that are inside the monastery because across the country, there is a rule: "no shoes, no photos." That is, if you're entering a sacred religious area of the temple and need to remove your shoes, then you cannot take a photo. The insides of the temples are really something though. Usually a monastery has several rooms, each as its own "temple." In the center will be one large idol, often covered in gold, flanked by several other idols. The idols are typically adorned in vibrant colors of cloth and in front, will be lamps filled with ghee, money that people have stashed in the nooks as a donation, and other religious objects like wax sculptures, food offerings and stupas. The structures are usually wood (and yes, this means many a monastery have been burned down by the ghee fueled flames, including Tiger's Nest) and the interior is usually as ornate, sometimes even more so, carved and painted as the exterior of the building. The ceilings are draped with more colorful, embroidered cloths and the walls are usually covered in either detailed paintings that represent various stories or beliefs about Buddhism or tiny idols of either Bodhisattvas (these are humans that have become "enlightened" but have chosen to stay within the human "realm" or lifecycle rather than escaping infinite reincarnation as they've earned) or Buddha himself. Sangay was really quite knowledgeable and passionate about explaining various parts of Buddhism, but I'll be honest, a lot of it escaped mine and Kevin's understanding. Kevin at one point tried to read the Buddhism Wikipedia article to try to understand a bit better all the symbolism in the monasteries but it quickly went into the deep end and with so many variations and interpretations, it was a bit challenging to understand everything. We asked Sangay about these different variations at one point and he said something that made sense. He said Buddhism's ultimate goal is simple, which is "eternal peace" or _Nirvana_. The variations are simply different sets of instructions or paths on how to get there.

We have lots of photos of the exteriors of the many monasteries we visited though. Every single one was beautifully decorated and covered in symbolic art and typically strung with prayer flags around the property and the path to get there. Almost always, getting to the monastery required a bit of a trek to get there. We visited one in the village of Sopsokha after our trek that was out of the ordinary because it was one that was built by the "Divine Madman;" a monk who shunned the typical modest way of living by monks and instead used outrageous and unconventional behavior to demonstrate to the common people that the path to "enlightenment" need not be the same for all. He also apparently "subdued evils" using the phallus because the phallus represents "the flaming thunderbolt of wisdom" (I have made a choice here to remain in ignorance and not figure out what on earth this means) and now the entire town is filled with shops that sell phalluses. The outside of buildings are also commonly painted with phalluses with varying levels of luridity. His temple is well known in Bhutan as a place to receive a fertility blessing and there's a cute scrapbook inside the temple with all sorts of pictures and notes from parents who prayed at the temple and were blessed with a child. It took me a while to notice, but hanging on the rearview mirror of our driver's car was also a tiny phallus. It's quite a common artifact to have in Bhutanese homes as a way to ward off evil, like hanging chilies in the doorway (common in India but also other parts of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean).

About half of our time in Bhutan was spent on the trek though. We started the trek in Paro and ended in Thimphu, which is the capital and largest city of Bhutan. We met our entourage on our first day which included a lunch boy, a horseman, a cook, and six mules. Plus Kevin, myself, and Sangay. About a kilometer or two into the first day of the hike, we passed by a fancy five-star hotel that was under construction and there, we met a cute white and beige stray dog. The dog started following us and we figured that he would probably turn back after a half hour or so. Nope. I kid you not, this stray dog stayed with us for the _entire fifty five kilometers all the way to Thimphu_ and decided to act as our guard dog for our camp. I still wonder what happened to him afterwards. Did he perhaps find another trekking group going in the opposite direction back to Paro? Is he just hanging out in Thimphu now? Kevin and I started calling him "Squiggles" or "Squigs" for short. The Bhutanese crew called him "Katu" which means "white" in Bhutanese because of the color of his coat. He brought a lot of joy to us all and would wait patiently every morning and evening until after we all ate to eat all the leftover food. Sometimes, if I didn't like something much (there were some egg pancakes that I couldn't manage for breakfast one day), I would sneak him food under the table. He was such a joy; he loved leaping onto Kevin, would run to our tent and wag his tail vigorously and clamor onto us when we emerged from the tent in the mornings (as long as he wasn't out on his guarding duties) and just generally was a very happy doggo. He would usually trek with the horseman and his horses though often go off on his own adventures, adding on more mileage than any of us. He didn't like the camp fires much, though would sit close to us occasionally if we were seated far enough away from a roaring hot fire. He didn't like other dogs as well, scaring off any dog that dared to approach us even from many meters away. Squigs definitely made the trek special for us all.

Oh look who it is catching up on the trail!

The trek itself was really wonderful. We passed through beautiful forests and even on the first day, started getting views of the snow-capped mountains that Bhutan is known for. We saw Jomolhari from afar almost daily. Days three and four were especially spectacular. On day three, we were about to get to our camp super early so we decided to do a little extra hike up to the top of a nearby mountain that was only maybe one hundred meters or so further up. There wasn't really a trail so we bushwhacked our way up, scrambling up some of the rocks, testing out the solidity with our hiking poles and carefully stepping to avoid any hidden holes. The views were really amazing and Sangay looked back at us and pointed to another peak further ahead and said, "one more?" So we climbed up one more peak and this was even more beautiful with us being able to see over the other side of the ridge to another lake that Sangay had never seen before. There was a tiny semi-permanent tent as well where a shepherd must be living, tucked in the valley of some very tall mountains. There were some plants that we were bushwhacking that Sangay mentioned not to touch too much because the smell can sometimes induce altitude sickness/vomiting but but the end of our bonus climb and descent, we had definitely touched it plenty and also gotten quite a bit higher in altitude so I was very happy that no altitude sickness kicked in. Ooh, there were some thorny plants that definitely gave us a few scratches and pierced through our pants though -- oww! With our additional climbs, we ended up at camp at a respectable four o'clock which gave us enough time to do a quite wet wipe "bath," change into our camp clothes and get warmed up by the fire. Staying in valleys meant that we were shielded by the winds but it also meant that the sun set very early over the tops of the mountains and also rose pretty late. Each morning, we would wake up to a white sheet of frost across everything, including Squiggles.

Day four is when we reached the peak of our hike. We passed through our highest pass of our trek around 4300 meters and had some beautiful views of the tallest mountain in Bhutan: Gangkar Puensam. The weather wasn't as clear as some of the previous days, but we were definitely able to see the expanse of snow-capped mountains across the horizon from the pass. Sometimes it takes a moment for my eyes to distinguish between what's a cloud and what's the top of a mountain -- they're all at the same height! I really enjoyed watching the colorful prayer flags that were strung across all the mountain passes flap around in the wind, but this one definitely had a lot more flags and structures constructed from the flags. It was clear that we had reached the highest point of the trek. It's funny how easily we ran out of breath during ascents on this trek; even a small climb had me panting in just a couple minutes so I would try to take it slowly and at a constant pace. I remember one of the first treks we did in Hong Kong (the next place we went after Bhutan) at nearly sea level and both Kevin and I were lapping the other hikers, nearly sprinting up steps to the top of the hike. It felt like we had superpowers at sea level and like I was completely out of shape for the Druk Path. In reality, Kevin and I apparently completed the trek in the quickest amount of time that Sangay had done with clients and we took both him and our travel agent by surprise by how quickly we finished hikes. Based on the other clientele we met, it seemed like the average age was quite a bit older than us and very few did trekking. Sangay was in fact, the only trekking guide that the travel agency employed and all others were just cultural guides. I guess trekking isn't very common even though the Himalayas on the Bhutanese side are also stunning and even more untouched than the Nepalese Himalayas.

Camp locations were often quite unique. Our first night, we camped close to a monastery that looked pretty empty, but I was told it still was active. It was perched on top of a hill with a view of Jomolhari and Kevin managed to find a small ledge just below the "summit" that was shielded from the wind where we shared a beer and watched the sunset. Our second night was spent on a yak farm and we met a lovely English lady who was also hiking the Druk Path and camping in the same place for the evening. The whole area was full of yaks which seemed to get along fine with our mules but we did have to be careful where we stepped as there was yak and horse poo everywhere. While I was napping in the tent, Kevin and the English lady were chatting when one of the yaks decided to try to scare them and started charging towards them before stopping. Then it ran a bit closer and stopped again. They figured it was time to get out of there at that point so Kevin returned back to our tent. We were careful to keep a large distance between ourselves and that yak afterwards; I think it was a female yak that had babies which would explain that behavior. It was definitely a unique experience to camp there and watch the yak herder milk the yaks in the morning. Yak milk is not very commonly drunk in Bhutanese because it is expensive but people believe that yak milk is medicinal because the yak's primary diet is mountain herbs so if you're ill, people will either drink yak milk then or chew on some dried yak cheese. Kevin and I tried some dried yak cheese when we later visited a market in Thimphu and I felt like I nearly dislocated my jaw trying to chew on the yak cheese. I need to work my jaw muscles!

This lake was our campsite for the third night.

</figcaption>

We were extremely pampered with amazing food throughout the trek (and also throughout the trip in general). On the trek, typically we would have cereal and something hot for breakfast along with milk and tea. The something hot would sometimes be toast or eggy toast or scrambled eggs or eggy pancakes (we obviously had some extra eggs in our food supply by the end of our trek). Lunch would be a luxurious meal set of rice, two vegetable dishes, and a meat dish for the carnivores. Dinner would be rice, three vegetables dishes and usually a meat dish or a fourth vegetable dish. One of our favorite dishes was called _datshi_ which was a vegetable (often mushrooms) in a cheesy white sauce with shredded chilis. Bhutanese people usually eat rice for all three meals but thankfully we did not have to eat rice for breakfast which would have been a bit too much rice for us. All the meals were served with lots of tea; in Bhutan, people drink plain black tea though very lightly brewed. We ended up switching to just drinking hot water in the evenings to give us our best chance of sleeping at night.

Our third night was spent near a very still lake that had a perfect reflection of the surrounding mountains and whose edges were lined with perfectly flat stones. Kevin did some of his best stone skipping here with the perfect stones and lake. We saw some other folks camping on the other side of the lake that Sangay told us were likely some local students. We didn't see them at all on our walk so they probably came from Thimphu and were going towards Paro, so trekking in the opposite direction as us. From night two onwards, we had huge fires going in our camp; making campfires is technically illegal in the Bhutanese parks but the cold pretty much forces everyone to make fires. I'm not sure how it's possible to have such a law in place, especially since there are shepherds and herders who live in semi-permanent tents in the area who probably need the fires to stay warm. In any case, this particular night, Sangay made sure that the folks on the opposite side were not rangers and once confirmed, made the fire.

The views!!

</figcaption>

Our last night of the trek was quite eventful. We arrived at our camp and Sangay went to work chopping down a _huge_ amount of firewood to build the biggest bonfire yet. As we were sitting by the fire, and the last of the light started to fade, we saw a tiny light up in the mountain, continuing along what looked like the trail to Thimphu. Sangay was a bit worried that the light might be from the students we saw earlier across the lake on the previous night and that they were trying to reach Thimphu within the same evening which was still another ten to twelve kilometers away. He said that it wasn't uncommon that students would try to do the trek underprepared without proper equipment or even headlamps, instead using a cell phone to light the way. We watched as the light disappeared and reappeared and Sangay whistled loudly to attract attention. The huge bonfire as well hopefully acted as a beacon in case they were in trouble. But eventually the light disappeared for good and the next day, Sangay speculated that it could have been some local shepherd who sells some of the mountain herbs in Thimphu who definitely know their way around.

After we finished up dinner, as we were huddling around the fire, our horseman went to go and grab his horses who were roaming around on the property and tie them up for the night. Sangay told us that usually, once a horse is done grazing, his instinct will be to start walking back home (towards Paro) and if they aren't tied close by, by morning, there will be zero horses left. There was another horse herder nearby who lived in a semi-permanent tent close to where we were camping who was doing the same and counting his horses. We realized that there was some commotion going on and our camp staff all started roaming around the area with strong flashlights: one of the horses was missing. At the time, we thought it was one of our horses, but later on we found out it was the local herder's horse. After some time, they found the horse laying sideways in the creek that was between our camp and the herder's dwellings. The horse had been in a tussle with a loose yak that we had earlier seen roaming around close to where we had started our descent into our camping area. The yak belonged to a herder who actually hadn't arrived in the area yet. They were scheduled to arrive within the next couple days and had left some material for the semi-permanent tent that would be set up but I guess one yak got there early. The horse had been on the losing side and had been stabbed in the belly by the yak's horns. Our staff tried to help and hold down the horse while his owner tried to push the organs that were now on the outside of the horse back in and stitch it up but the extent of damage was too much. It was really traumatic to see (the trekking staff had nerves of steel as they tried as hard as they could to help) and I was heartbroken when we saw him try to cross the creek to be with the other horses who had been rounded up for the night. Horrible, horrible. It was really impossible to save the horse because of how much distance there was to the city where there was a vet and also the extreme nature of the injury. We were nervous about Katu overnight (he is a dog after all) but after sniffing the horse, he came back to our camp, got some stern words in Bhutanese from the trekking staff, and sat down and didn't leave our camp all night.

As we made our final descent into Thimphu, we started seeing signs of civilization again. We passed by a very isolated monastery that had signs around to please trek quietly. This monastery is where people who wish to become monks spend three years, three months, and three days meditating. They don't leave the property at all during this time and are completely cut off from the rest of the world. We were taking quite a speedy pace down the hill, gaining superpowers as the oxygen increased and Sangay had to call Jigme three times, each time to give him an earlier estimated arrival time. It was really nice to be greeted by not only Jigme, but also the English lady that we had met at the start of the trek since we had slightly different campsites for the latter half of the trek. We all celebrated with wine and beer and Sangay arranged a stunning lunch for us that was the best meal of our trip: tempura mushrooms, paneer masala, chicken, fish, the best chili cheese, and tons more. We ate, took extremely long hot showers, and napped and enjoyed chilling out in a beautiful room because we got upgraded to a lovely four star hotel that was actually owned by our travel agency. I don't think we realized how pooped we were from not sleeping very well in the cold. We slept very well this and every subsequent night of our time in Bhutan.

After our trek, we had three days remaining in Bhutan. We spent two of the days in Punakha and the surrounding areas. We visited a mountain pass by car that unfortunately was fully clouded, but the view was very pretty from the top of a monastery nearby regardless. We visited the Divine Madman's monastery that I mentioned earlier, a nunnery for female monks, another fortress, a lovely long suspension bridge crossing over a turquoise river fed by the melting snow of a nearby glacier, and a third monastery that passed through a field of rice paddies that were being cleaned up for the season. Our last day was a whirlwind in Thimphu. We were outfitted with traditional Bhutanese dresses in the morning; for me a _kira_ that consisted of a blouse and skirt with the blouse sleeves folded up to represent hospitality and compassion. Kevin was outfitted in a _gho_ which was a single piece that normally would be worn pantless with tall socks but Kevin wore jeans underneath. The comfort of the dresses wasn't too bad actually, though I couldn't take long strides so after visiting the largest sitting Buddha in the world in the morning, we took them off. We spent the remainder of the day visiting other small sights including an art school, a takin reserve (the takin in the national animal of Bhutan), an archery match, a farmer's market, and watched the flag lowering at the Tashichho Dzong which is the sort of "White House" of Bhutan where the king does his work and where the Chief Abbot lives. The archery match was especially really entertaining to watch. The targets are set 150 meters away (in contrast, the Olympic target is set 70 meters away) which means that the archers frequently miss, but when they do hit the target, the entire team performs a dance. The teams would constantly be shouting at each other and waving the flags next to the target to point out the target. 150 meters is a lot! I could barely keep my eyes focused on the arrow as it flew through the air. Kevin and I had some fun trying out archery after our hot stone bath early on in the trip but the target was way closer. Sangay told us that the competition we were watching was some sort of national event between teams from the different villages and towns of Bhutan and one of the teams came from his village out in east Bhutan. Archery is the national sport of Bhutan and he said that pretty much all the men learn to do some archery at some point in their childhood.

Bhutan is the only country in the world that has not a single traffic light. We were amused by this traffic police regulating traffic in an intricately designed pavilion.

The flag lowering ceremony was also fun. This was the last thing we did in Bhutan. The actual area where the flag is lowered is closed off so tourists get to the fence surrounding the area very early to get a good spot to spy through the bushes. Sangay was quite the expert in getting us there at a good time and finding us a nice place. After the flag lowering ceremony is completed, the dzong opens up for a short period of time each day to tourists but the guides need to register each person first. As the ceremony finished, I found it amusing how all the guides started sprinting towards the registration office so that they could register first. We made our way to the entrance and soon enough, Sangay called our names to wave us into the dzong where we visited another monastery that is more frequently used by government officials and the Chief Abbot. Bhutan has an interesting split leadership at the top in having both a king and a chief abbot. The king is ultimately responsible for the more secular and political side of the leadership responsibilities while the abbot takes on the religious. The current king and his dad appear to be quite well loved in Bhutan and while we were there, the country celebrated the king's father's 69th birthday which was a day off for everyone. It was really interesting to see many of the Bhutanese people wear pins in commemoration of the birthday with the king's dad's face on it. The current king is known for trying to turn Bhutan into more of a democracy. Sangay said that so far, they've had the ability to vote four times after the king decided that members of the National Assembly (their parliament) should be voted in by the public every five years. So in 2008, Bhutan held their first elections. The current king is also working on a new project to create a "megacity" in the south of Bhutan called [Gelephu](https://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanmadden/2024/01/30/land-of-the-thunder-dragon-bhutan-announces-new-mindfulness-megacity/). It's going to have the second international airport that won't require special training to land and take-off (so that wealthy business folks can more easily conduct business in Bhutan) and new railways to connect the city with the rest of the country. It sounds really ambitious and the work has already started so it'll be interesting to see if Bhutan manages to pull it off. Sangay said that the king is currently spending a bunch of his time trying to make sure they raise enough funds to complete the project. For me, it's really interesting to see how Bhutan handles their sometimes opposing desires to modernize and also retain their traditional culture. Bhutan will certainly become a really interesting place to visit again in another ten plus years, especially after their new city is constructed. Their culture is very beautiful and their country is really lovely to visit!

Dancing and singing after their teammate hit the target!
