I procrastinated on writing these blog posts for so long partially due to the photos from Singapore. Over the course of last year, the time I spent on photography and especially post-processing dramatically increased. I was that crazy person trying to squat in weird angles to capture the perfect lighting on the spiky stalagmites in a cramped cave messing with my ISO and aperture settings to try to get the least grainy photo possible while having a shutter speed fast enough that my unsteady hands wouldn't blur the photo. This meant that I would take tens, if not hundreds of photos in a day and then the process of sorting through them became so overwhelming that I just put it off. Occasionally I would get discouraged altogether because even after I sorted through the photos, I would end up thinking that not a single one captured the wondrousness that I was trying to snapshot forever. I have a great admiration for photographers who do this professionally and create masterpieces that manage to make me feel like I'm right there in the scene they've captured, feeling the same emotions that they did.

But as they say, perfect is the enemy of good and here we are about two months post-traveling, a few posts behind schedule. I got inspired again to write as we left Grenoble and while on the plane from Lyon to London, I started writing that post. It's not finished, but just the act of writing reminded me of how much I like to write. I also did manage to finally sort through the Singapore photos and so felt like it was time. So here I am, four days into moving to London, fondly remembering our phenomenal time in Singapore.

When we have traveled in the past, we usually go to a place to visit the location itself. As in: “I want to go to Botswana because there are cool safaris there and I want to see a safari.” Or “let’s plan a trip to Fiji because we want a beach vacation and I’d like to visit a place other than Hawaii and oooh, there’s a direct flight from San Francisco.” What this year has afforded us is the ability to travel to places because there is a cool thing happening there and the goal is to see the cool thing and maybe something else but not always. We did this with seeing the Nomad Games in Astana, Kazakhstan. Again with Diwali in Mumbai, India. Euros in Munich. And we did it again with visiting Singapore for the World Chess Championship (WCC) that happened to perfectly time itself with our Asian leg of our trip.

I don’t play much chess at all. I played a bit when I was in elementary school, wolfing down my lunches every Wednesday at top speeds so that I could hang out with the other “Chess Club” kids, playing a few games behind the school’s stage area that had been set up with small cheap foldable plastic tables and chairs. I can’t remember how long I did that, but it wasn’t very long. Kevin, on the other hand, loves to play online chess and pretty regularly catches up on the chess world “happenings.” He mentioned that the championship was happening in Singapore and we were already sort of planning on visiting the city so it was easy to say, let’s do it, and time our visit so that it landed so that we’d be able to watch the first match.

In preparation for the match, I asked ten billion questions about chess to Kevin, especially while hiking in Bhutan. Even though I knew I wouldn't be able to totally understand everything going on, watching the best of the best play in any sport is a special and inspiring experience so my enthusiasm was high. I downloaded a chess app and started to work through some puzzles. I played some online chess where I magically won my first game and then proceeded to lose pretty much everything else. Perhaps it was futile anyways because there’s no way I was going to understand the strategies that the two grandmasters who were playing: defending champion Ding Liren and the young eighteen year old, Gukesh Dommaraju, who was vying to be the youngest ever winner of the WCC (there's an asterisk here which is that he's the _undisputed_ youngest world champion for reasons that are too in-the-weeds/historical for me to describe or dig into). At least by the end of my own preparation, I could understand the meaning of the double exclamation mark, !!, that was the icon for the WCC and I could read what moves had been played and I learned the names (note: not the exact moves) of a few openings and their relative advantages and disadvantages. Not bad for a couple weeks of small time spent!

But first food. Singapore Hawker Fare. Look, I had quite a few people tell me that Singapore was a city worth visiting for maybe a day or two and that’s about it. Did you eat at the hawker stalls?! Singapore hawker stalls are these giant areas, packed with small stalls serving dirt cheap food that blow your taste buds away. Being vegetarian isn’t a problem at all. And with Singapore being one of the few countries out in this part of the world where English is the official language, the food is multicultural, just like the people. You can find authentic laksa, satay, Thai curries, Malaysian specialities, sushi, cronuts (why not), and so many other dishes that I had no idea even existed. I envied the people who worked close to Lau Pa Sat, strategically positioned in the midst of many skyscrapers filled with probably finance people. They all wore dress pants creased down the front and all tailored to exactly the right length which I associate with finance people. Those people probably justifiably get their Monday to Friday lunches at a stall. It’s like a food court on steroids. I kid you not, a couple of the hawker fare stalls have a Michelin star. It’s probably the cheapest Michelin star meal you could get in the whole world. Kevin got it and he thinks it’s deserved. Maybe eventually you want to be looking out for your sodium levels but hey, if you’re wearing dress pants and long sleeves in that crazy humidity, you probably need that sodium anyways, sweating it all out. All of the above to say, “street” food in Singapore is awesome.

Anyways, back to chess. One does not normally think of chess as a spectator sport. Let me enlighten you: watching the World Chess Championship in Singapore is like watching the Euros but everyone is panic-whispering rather than yelling when the games get close. There's spicy drama. There's endless strategy predictions by the pundits. There's the post-match withering reviews by the scrutinizing Grandmasters. The Reddit memes. The random appearance of tech tycoons. It's got it all.

We got tickets for the first two days of the championship which is played over 14 games in two and a half weeks. The event was held at a five star hotel situated on an island, Sentosa Island, which is sort of like an island full of theme parks. Normally when people visit the island, I believe the experience is supposed to be like visiting a resort where you stay on the island and everything is included with your stay: the theme park entries, food, sleeping arrangements, etc. Funny enough, there were absolutely no good food options while we were there but I became an expert at hiding some protein bars in my bag so that we could take breaks from games and eat them outside the venue.

We arrived at the hall the first day, panting and completely drenched because the taxi couldn't drive us all the way to the venue (cars had to pay extra fees to drive on the island if not part of the resort) and we got lost and of course, it started to pour and we started running. We entered the hall and Kevin exclaimed, "did we just crash an AI conference?!" Smack in the middle, dominating the entire lobby was a giant Google AI display, full of Google employees, including Demis Hassabis, talking to people about their latest release called [GenChess](https://labs.google/genchess) where you could create a virtual chess set using any theme you set as the creative inspiration. Actually their setup was super fun: they had big screens where you could play around with their AI to create a chess set and then you could pick one to print. We had some fun building cute potato chess pieces but unfortunately I clicked "regenerate" and we lost our cutest potato pawn. Oh well.

The venue was divided into roughly three areas. One was the main lobby area with the huge Google display and also a tiny FIDE shop tucked in the back. People would largely socialize here with cups of the unlimited tea and coffee the organization provided. Then there was the fan zone. The fan zone was an area where TVs were set up with the game running with commentary that was being recorded live in a room nearby. Periodically, grandmasters would hang out in the fan zone, maybe do a Q&A. There were also tons of chess boards set up around the room for people to play; Kevin played a few rounds of chess with people here. It was really fun to see such a mix of kids and adults playing chess, even against each other. Some of these kids are so incredibly talented! I also appreciated the bean bags tossed around the room to lounge in. These were definitely popular.

Finally, the playing room. I was curious how they would maintain silence for the players. The playing room is essentially fitted with a glass box in which Ding and Gukesh would play. There were also judges and referees in the box and at the very beginning of the game, photographers and videographers as well. All of the spectators were in the same ballroom, but outside the box. I'm sure the glass box was not entirely soundproof, but there were very strict requirements around being quiet in the spectator room (thus why no food: you aren't allowed to crinkle anything) so it was probably pretty quiet in there. For the first thirty minutes of every game, they would allow photos to be taken and then afterwards, they would shoo everyone out to lock away all electronics including phones before they could come back inside.

It's pretty awesome to watch inside the spectator room. You can immediately feel some of the tension and people on the edge of their seats. The first game was particularly intense. Gukesh started with white pieces (usually an advantage to be able to try to win outright) and Ding had spent a long time on a very early move which was quite unusual because the first moves are usually played memorized. Suddenly in mid-game, Ding started busting out a series of moves that had Gukesh on the backfoot and by the end, people in the audience room were madly whispering various moves to each other to see whether Gukesh could even scrape a draw. He could not. With just seconds on the clock, Ding managed to win outright with black pieces on the first game. The room erupted with applause. I thought about half the room would walk out with a good chunk of their hair missing from all the tense yanking.

We watched a second game as well the following day though this one ended up as a draw and was much less intense than the first one as both players seemed to be pretty ready to draw early on. Even though we only saw two matches live, we continued to keep up with the matches online and two and a half weeks later, Gukesh became the youngest FIDE world champion just eking out a win 7.5 to 6.5. Lots of memes were borne from videos of Ding eating bananas and walnuts and not having ice cream. Both players were easy to root for. Both players graciously acknowledged each other's strengths and prowesses during interviews. When press conferences would occasionally ask spicy questions, they both answered maturely, sidestepping controversy. It was nice to see Ding play very solidly throughout the game as many had doubted his form after a period of mental struggles and taking a break from chess. Neither Kevin nor I were rooting strongly for one or the other so it was just a really enjoyable championship to watch with some great, intense chess being played.

I should remember to seek out more experiences like this in the future. I really loved spending a few weeks diving so deeply into chess and watching some of the best players play. One of my favorite things in the world is talking to anyone who cares so deeply about whatever the context is and there's so much of that at the top level competitions of anything. It reminds me of watching a cobbler I used to visit in Toronto carefully peering at a pair of fancy shoes I needed to repair and remark how beautiful they were and eagerly advise me on how to take care of them without prompting. He really likes shoes and he was probably the best cobbler in all of Toronto. Or even today when I went to a gym class and the trainer carefully watched me, hawk eyed, to make sure the barbell was exactly perpendicular before I lifted. Even just a few degrees askew and he would quickly jump in to adjust. His love for training and teaching people so easily came through. Watching the best, the most passionate people do what they do is infectious and I suppose as I start hunting for a new job, it's something I think about quite often as something to aspire for. I'll find it in good time!

I'll drop a few photos below of more things we did in Singapore besides eat food and watch chess! We definitely filled our days by visiting gorgeous gardens and museums as well!

We saw this exhibit at the Asian Civilizations Museum. These bowls were excavated from the Tang shipwreck from 830AD. There was some interesting commentary about the method of excavating, including the use of private companies to do the excavation. Interestingly, the commentary at the museum was about how not much would have been done if private companies hadn’t been used (not enough bandwidth) and so a compromise was required.

These “super trees” are actually quite cool. They have solar panels and also collect rainwater and between the two, help to cool down the nearby conservatories. Also they light up in a cool music-synchronized show in the evenings.
