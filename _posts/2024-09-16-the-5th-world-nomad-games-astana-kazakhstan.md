Kevin and I are on a sleeper train traveling from Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, to Burabay (or Borovoye) National Park. We’re not actually spending an overnight on the train; this train has been traveling for over twenty-four hours and made a fifty-two minute stop at Astana station where the majority of folks got off the train. We got on to take the train up further north for three hours. The train car is full of bedding everywhere and Kevin just hauled himself up onto the top bunk to catch a bit of extra sleep before we arrive. The sleeper train is almost identical to the ones I’ve taken before in India; on the right side of the carriage, there are two pairs of bunk beds and on the left side, there is a single set of bunk beds. The train moves at a very similar speed; I love the gentle rattling when the train hits its cruise speed which honestly puts me straight to sleep. Let’s see how long I can stay awake to write this post.

Before we left New York, Kevin and I were debating between visiting Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Kyrgyzstan has some incredible hiking in the mountains and we were eager to use our legs again after lots of sitting in cars in Africa. However, we learned that the World Nomad Games happened to be starting in Kazakhstan on September 8th, just one day after our planned arrival in Central Asia. The World Nomad Games, we learned, are sort of the Olympics of very old and traditional games that are commonly played in Central Asia. Some of them are absolutely wild. There is kok-par which is a game where teams on horseback try to place a headless goat carcass into their team’s goal ring at an end of the arena. There is a nearly identical game called kok-boru where the goat carcass is instead hauled up and into a large pit placed at each end of the area. There is kurash, which is very similar to judo. There’s horseback archery, eagle hunting (competitors train the eagles to hunt), mas-wrestling (trying to grab a stick away from another player), mancala (the game that many of us played as a child), horseback wrestling, assyk-atu (throwing goat talus bone pieces at an opponent's pieces lined up in the middle of a circle, similar to marbles), and many more. We had never heard or seen of some of these games and while some of them sound totally crazy, the competition is serious and is a matter of national pride to perform well. We just had to go see it and since we were in Kazakhstan anyways and the country is huge, we decided to drop Kyrgyzstan, make Kazakhstan our next destination and take a flight from New York to Astana with a layover in Istanbul (hello again!).

We ended up spending two full days at the Games and another two to three days exploring the city. Astana is a strange city. The city has many large futuristic-looking buildings, including lots of weirdly spherical or egg-shaped buildings, but everything is very spread apart and the city feels oddly empty. Most people speak both Kazakh and Russian; younger folks will typically also speak English, but older folks will not. Everyone seemed very comfortable with using translation apps on their phone to help translate though so communication isn’t too bad. I found entering the country to be hilarious; US citizens don’t need a visa to enter and when the immigration officer asked me why I was coming to the country and I responded with “tourism,” he paused a beat, looked at me, and repeated back incredulously “tourism?!” I guess they don’t get very many visitors? After getting off the plane, we saw a big volunteer group from the Nomad Games organization waiting to greet folks and then we realized that the majority of folks on our flight were actually athletes and their teams coming to participate in the games. We saw the teams taking pictures after exiting customs and it was cute to see all the welcoming signs the country has put up for the Games.

Our first night in Astana was ambitious; after traveling for something like twenty-one hours, we checked into our Airbnb, a simple, yet functional and comfortable apartment on the 33rd floor of one of the many high rise complexes in the city, took showers, and went straight to the season opening gala at the Astana Opera. We were perhaps a touch undressed (I do distinctly recall wearing my hiking pants while other attendees were striding in their slinky dresses and stilettos) but everyone we talked to (we needed their help to find our seats and stuff) was very nice and we had a great time watch a series of short performances by the symphony and their opera stars over the next hour and a half. It was a nice format for our sleep-deprived state; each aria or piece only lasted about ten minutes and each had a different performer (or set of performers). The music was beautiful, the venue was gorgeous, and we loved getting to hear a whole range of pieces that were all composed by Kazakhstani composers. We stayed awake just long enough to grab some yummy Italian food at a nearby restaurant after the gala and walked back to our apartment and fell dead asleep, no problem, for many hours. Oh yeah, the crosswalks here are cute; in addition to the walk and stop signal, they have a green happy face and a red sad face that turns on when it’s time to walk or stop respectively.

The next day was our city day. We paid a visit to the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a glass pyramid building that was built for an important triennial meeting between religious leaders of the world (including Pope Francis) to foster collaboration. Today, the building is a sort of cultural museum and also has an event venue and opera house. It was a pretty cool experience to start to understand a bit more about Kazakh culture and how it has been influenced by the Turkic people that arrived around the 5th century, followed by its inclusion in the Mongol Empire, and then the Russian Empire. Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet Union republics to declare independence in 1991 and ten days after that happened, the Soviet Union entirely dissolved.

We wandered around the city a bit afterwards, checking out some outdoor art installations and sculptures as well as a huge mosque nearby. I nearly got lost because I had to go down into the dungeon, erm basement, first to wear Yoda-like robes and there are lots of random passageways to all sorts of things like shops, a kitchen, offices, and different praying areas. Roughly 80% of Kazakhs are Muslim and Astana has several huge, gorgeous mosques peppered throughout the city. As with every place we’ve visited, they’re pretty empty, especially given the size. There is also a Russian Orthodox Christian church in the city, but unfortunately we weren’t able to make it out there. We’re going to be right next to a famous one in Almaty in a few days so we’ll check out that one instead.

We ended our day at the National Museum which was a behemoth museum with paleontology exhibits (the wooly mammoth and T-Rex skeletons were awesome), art exhibits, ancient artifact exhibits, and more. It was definitely a very cool museum with tons of information about Kazakhstan’s history dating back to the 2nd-3rd century BC.

Then we had two full days of Nomad Games! I am so glad we ended up choosing to come here for the Games because they were so much fun. We’re a bit bummed that we couldn’t snag tickets to the Opening Ceremony, but at least tickets to the competitions were readily available and inexpensive (typically around five to seven dollars per person). The city did an amazing job making sure that the competitions run smoothly and there were also tons of cultural events happening just outside of the stadiums and arenas that were free for anyone to come and enjoy. It was really cool that it seemed like people of all ages had something fun to do besides just watching the sports. We spent the majority of the first day watching kok-par and I could not hold in my laughter watching the teams grab the goat (they use a dummy headless goat carcass for the competition), shove it under a leg for security, and gallop their horse as fast as possible to the goal. The Kyrgyzstan fans came out in full force for their team, completely with traditional drums and far less traditional vuvuzelas. The Kazakhstan team absolutely murdered the Uzbekistan team fourteen to zero. The Russians beat out the Chinese (what an interesting match up there!). The Kyrgyzstan team dominated over Mongolia. To our mixed feelings of dread and delight, guess who else’s team was participating? The USA! Kevin found one of the USA team player’s Twitter who documented that the team was composed of a random group of cowboys who primarily compete in rodeos in the US. They learned about the sport in 2018 and have never practiced together as a team and had no access to a goat carcass so instead practiced using bags of cattle feed. And this team was up against Kazakhstan in the first round of kok-boru (the version where the carcass has to be hauled up and into a pit).

Look! The American player has a hand on the goat! He didn't actually manage to grab it though :(

</figcaption>

We were decimated. Eighteen zero. But boy did I have a fun time cheering them on. I think they did a little better, at least, defending the goal occasionally. And I think one of the players at least was holding one of the goal legs at one point! Tough matchup though and gotta give them props for a valiant effort!

Our first day, we also saw traditional archery in a nearby area and then we headed over to the “Ice Palace” where their rink had been turned into an arena for more wrestling-like sports. We saw the end of the mas-wrestling competition (“mas” means stick) and the ladies kurash competition and saw a bit of the medal ceremonies as well.

Our second day was filled with more horseback games. We saw Turkish-style horseback archery which involved competitors performing two different types of runs, each twice. The first run involved galloping the horse across the field while shooting three eye level targets. The second involved galloping across the field and first shooting a small target on the ground (mimicking shooting a lion or other predator from olden days) and shooting a metal plate that was many meters up (mimicking shooting down a messenger bird sent from an enemy). To no one’s surprise, the players from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were incredible; their upper bodies were totally still while their horses galloped at an incredible speed. A competitor from Thailand and a couple from Indonesia were also exceptionally good. The French competitors were clearly excellent horsemen but oftentimes missed the targets. The Canadians barely seemed like they knew how to ride a horse.

We watched the tail end of horseback wrestling this day and also had some fun roaming around the cultural area that had been set up. There were tons of yurts, many selling different tchotchkes, lots of stalls selling food and ice creams, and various performances either on a high production stage or randomly between the yurts. It was very cool to see lots of kids performing their traditional dances in the traditional Kazakh clothing and also generally learn about their culture; they even had a mock wedding going on at one point (which involved showering the bride with candy like a smashed piñata). There were lots of people who were curious where we came from (we still say Canada… much nicer reception in pretty much every single place on Earth so far and we avoid any questions about politics) and at one point, I got dragged into a random photo with a random person and I’m pretty sure my face looked like it was totally confused because I absolutely was. Kazakh people drink lots of simple black tea with milk (which is fantastic for me) and a local tea company, Piada, was handing out free cups to my delight. The weather held up beautifully; it felt exactly like summer to fall transition weather with a bit of chill coming on in the evenings and the atmosphere was celebratory and fun. This experience really makes me want to try to see the Olympic Games at some point in my life. Maybe it’ll be a bit more chaotic and crowded but it’s hard to imagine that the joy and pride of the teams, visitors, and locals won’t feel the same and equally infectious.

We had one last half day of roaming around Astana the day after. We needed some planning time (we’re planning on doing a road trip from Almaty, but need to organize a driver who speaks English) but after that, we visited a cool spherical building that was originally built for the World Fair held in Astana in 2017. The theme for that fair was “Future Energy” and so the spherical building now holds seven floors of exhibits, each dedicated to explaining and talking about the future of a particular type of energy such as solar, wind, biomass, kinetic, space, and others. It was a very high tech museum with tons of interactive exhibits, a mini planetarium, and beautiful views of the city from the top floors. The building itself is the largest spherical building in the world and the area around it has some pretty neat architecture that was fun to photograph.

We ended our day by visiting the iconic Baiterek monument. It sort of looks like a spiky ball hoisted into the air and visitors can go up into the sphere for 360 views of the city. We tried to make it in time for sunset, but were just a little too late but we got the gorgeous glow of the clouds and as time passed, the buildings started getting lit up for another beautiful scene. Astana is a strangely symmetrical city. It felt like in every direction, there was some aspect of symmetry whether that be the president’s palace with the symmetrical gardens or even in the distance with similarly tall buildings on either side of the street. The government of Kazakhstan is considered to be a civilian dictatorship and they’ve had only two presidents so perhaps it is unsurprising. It’s also a very clean city. One of our Yandex drivers (Yandex is the Russian Uber competitor) who was trying to learn English so that he could get a job in the US or Canada or Australia one day told us that he was originally from Almaty and he didn’t like Astana. He said that the people were too “angry” and Almaty was a more beautiful and friendly place. We’re looking forward to visiting it soon!

And that was the end of our Astana visit. We didn’t have too much exploration in terms of food besides some local donuts and Kevin tried a spiced rice and beef dish because we found a fantastically supplied grocery store nearby. The pricing is crazy though; the first time, we plopped stuff into our baskets without really looking at the prices and spent nearly one hundred dollars for a couple lunches, couple dinners, and some snacks and breakfasts. This time, we paid attention and realized that for a very similar item, prices could vary wildly based on the brand. For example, there were various similarly small sized jars of honey that varied from three dollars to over fifty dollars! A bag of oats could be less than one dollar or you can accidentally pay ten dollars. Or even produce: there were sweet peppers in different bins and one was three dollars per kilogram versus another bin was around fifty cents per kilogram. Just slightly different sized peppers. Since we were careful this time, for a similar amount of food, we paid just thirty dollars. Only one item seemed not to have any price fluctuations which was sour cream. Never before in my life have I seen such an extensive section of all sorts of sour cream.

Timing is great! In another fifteen minutes we’re about to reach Burabay station where we’ll spend the next few days hiking, biking and exploring the lakes. I’m excited to get back on track with writing blog posts after falling behind and the other African ones will be coming soon! Oooh look at that, the leaves are changing color. Guess it’s fall! Again :)
