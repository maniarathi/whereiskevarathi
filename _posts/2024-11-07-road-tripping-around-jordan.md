We’re on our way to Mumbai now, having departed Jordan early in the morning. It’s not often that I feel a bit melancholy leaving a place because I’m so looking forward to the next one. But with Jordan, as our driver kept saying “welcome to Jordan!” each time we gushed about another sight we enjoyed seeing in Jordan, I felt a bit sad to be leaving even though I am bonkers excited to be spending Diwali in India (a first for me!). I’ll miss the Jordanian hospitality that’s really on another level. I’ll miss visiting Hashem’s restaurant in Amman for cloud-like falafels and olive oil drenched hummus and ful and fatteh, where we ate five times in fewer than that many days (we learned that the owner is now in Bolivian prison for smuggling cocaine so uhhh maybe there was some other special ingredients in that hummus. No wonder it tasted so good). I’ll miss the sassy cats that want attention, but not too much attention, and definitely want food.

Our time in Jordan was broken up into two parts: for the first two weeks, we spent some time in Amman and then rented a car to drive around the country and visit other cities and sights. For the last week in Jordan, we trekked a section of the epic Jordan trail that began at the Dana Biosphere Reserve and ended by walking through the backdoor of Petra. I'll cover the second part in a second post because it really deserves its own. Visiting Jordan wasn't really on our plan for the year before we started, but like Türkiye, we ended up listening to another _Fall of Civilizations_ [podcast on the Nabataeans](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7Ho575TPrGODG5puISrAcx?si=6qST1mEmTFe1S2IDmcCklA) and decided that we wanted to see Petra, the capital of the Nabataeans and one of the most important trading cities, especially during the Iron Age. At the time, we were melting in Türkiye so we decided that hopping to another Middle Eastern country where temperatures top in the mid-forties during the summer was not the best idea so we skipped it for the summer. We were in the middle of our overlanding trip in Mangystau, just a couple days out from our flight to Amman, when our trip mate Betty managed to get some internet and let us know that Iran had launched missiles at Israel which were flying over Jordan. There were videos coming out from Amman showing the missiles across the night sky and we learned that the Jordan airspace was closed. However, by the time our trip ended in Mangystau, everything seemed like it was back to normal in Jordan with the airspace open. We had been keeping an eye out on any travel restrictions in Jordan from the US State Department but luckily, it continued to remain at Level 2 (where it has been for years) and so we continued our journey onwards. Our flight from Istanbul did take a "scenic route" to avoid flying over Israeli airspace so ended up a bit longer than scheduled, but otherwise, we didn't have any issues.

Visiting Jordan during this period of time was an interesting experience. From a tourism perspective, it's very clear that the war has had a devastating impact on the industry. During our first night in Dana, Kevin and I were the only people staying at the hotel. Many other times, it felt like we were one of many two or three other total groups at the hotel. All the sites we visited felt really empty and many shops and restaurants were shut close to the popular sites. We learned from research online that Jordan's tourism industry was especially booming before 2011 and then post Arab-spring, tourism plummeted by around 70 percent. It started to pick back up again towards the latter half of the decade before it was decimated again by COVID. And then started to recover again until October 7th, 2023 when once again, tourists fled. And since then, it hasn't recovered. Our guide, Munthar, from our Dana to Petra trek grumbled that he had switched the dates of the trek from the 24th to the 22nd of October to accommodate a guy from Kuwait but as soon as the missiles flew overhead, the guy canceled the whole trip. Munthar joked that he didn't understand why a Middle Eastern guy would cancel for some missiles as that's just normal stuff around here. We laughed along, but that's devastating to hear as a joke. We felt very safe during our time in Jordan and there were no obvious signs of disturbances in the country due to its neighbors except for one thing: the GPS had been spoofed by the Israeli military so that it looked like you were at the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman. This was especially true close to the border in the Aqaba and Dead Sea area. For some people, it would jump to Cairo. This had been ongoing since October 7th so people in Jordan were used to it to some extent, but it definitely threw off tourists who relied on GPS and Google Maps to get around. Luckily, there's pretty much just three highways in Jordan that run north-south and there are enough signs to point you to how to get on one of the highways or major tourist sites so navigation was pretty easy even without GPS. I was also lucky that my phone, after a few restarts, would sometimes be able to overcome the spoofing at least long enough to get us on the highway so we were able to skirt having any problems without GPS. Also, when it was really bad, we reverted back to our MapQuest era (remember MapQuest?!) by looking up the directions from point to point beforehand, noting any important landmarks to signal turns, and then driving according to the pre-planned route.

Humans have been around in this area of the world for a _long_ time. So have dinosaurs. It really didn't register with me before we came to Jordan, exactly how crazy old some of the remains here are. Many of the places we visited in Jordan were ancient ruins that were built like baklava, layer upon layer of historical eras, each of which has left its imprint on the site until around 749 AD when a huge earthquake (~7-7.5) hit the area and decimated many freestanding structures (but not many of the Petra structures that were carved directly into the rock which is why it's so spectacular!). Post-earthquake, some sites were rebuilt during the Umayyad period (start of the Islamic period) but many were abandoned. Stone, Bronze, Iron, Classical, and Middle ages -- you can see them all here, and all within a single location. I never got tired of especially seeing the flint tools from TEN THOUSAND years ago or seeing ancient idols demonstrating very early forms of religion like the two-headed plaster bust that might be one of the earliest examples of a human-worshipped thing from 7500 BC (the Neolithic period) or seeing shards of beautifully preserved pottery and glass from thousands of years ago and seeing the craft develop and beautify over hundreds and thousands of years. Nearly all the museums we visited as an accompaniment to the ancient site itself had artifacts from up to 10,000 years ago, if not older.

One rather interesting "museum" we went to in Amman was the Royal Automobile Museum. Apparently the father of the current king of Jordan was a huge car enthusiast and the huge warehouse showcased a bunch of his shiny expensive cars. I thought it might be a little cheesy, but it was genuinely a pretty cool museum with an impressive collection of vehicles plus vehicles from movies that were filmed in Wadi Rum like Star Wars and The Martian. The vast sandy landscape with red cliffs of Wadi Rum is a popular movie set location for any movie that involves desert landscapes or alien planets including the two previously mentioned, Dune, Transformers, and Star Trek. Of course there were some Bugattis and Ferraris as well. 

On the subject of the king. In Jordan, one is technically not allowed to insult or be disrespectful of royalty in an offense that is called _lèse-majesté,_ punishable by law usually with jail time. Because of this, it was really hard to get a read on how Jordanians thought about anything politics related. I ended up getting most of my information from our trekking companion, Esther, who had been living in Amman for the last year on a two-year work project, but originally from the UK. What I learned is that people in Jordan have mixed feelings; on one hand, people were frustrated by the level of poverty in the country and lack of support from the government but at the same time, observed the poorer quality of life in nearly every single one of their neighboring countries and felt grateful not to be a war zone. This law also meant that there were no demonstrations, no signs or displays, and hardly any graffiti (and trust me, there was a ton of graffiti other than declarations of love or just writing names or whatever else all over the parks) that were political in nature. I learned that about 25-30% of Jordan's population are non-residents with the majority coming from either Palestine or Syria so I figured people might have some opinions, but they were definitely not shown.

One big highlight of our Jordan tour was the Dead Sea. Going into it, I thought it might be a cool experience but didn't expect to be so fun that we made time to experience it twice. We stayed at a fancy-ish western hotel that had a private beach access and fresh water showers very close to the shore's edge. My experience with the Dead Sea really begins on the first day that we arrived in the Dead Sea area, the day before we actually went into the Dead Sea. We had done a "hiking" trail which was more of a "wading" trail through a place called Wadi Mujib. A "wadi" is just a dry riverbed though seasonally, it can have running water. This "wadi" has at least a bit of water nearly year-round with the water levels starting to rise around November. It was super fun hiking up the river with some ropes and ladders set up to go up some waterfalls until at last you reach a larger waterfall that cannot be scaled (I think they used to have a canyoning program to scale that one too but it has been closed for at least one year). Then to come back down, you can float along the river whenever the water is deep enough and some of the waterfalls had some slippery rocks that you could use as a slide to plop yourself down. I, not very smartly, decided to continue to try to float down the river even when the water was very shallow so I got my butt scraped up quite a bit by some small rocks, though I didn't really notice it at the time. It's a gorgeous canyon with beautiful swirly walls and we went back a second time, just up to the first waterfall area with our camera to take photos because we couldn't bring our camera the first time (it would have gotten drenched).

Well, the next day, as I waded into the 34% salinity lake, every single one of those tiny scrapes on my butt made itself known. Ouch! I learned about all the tiny cuts and nicks that were all over my body (as did Kevin) as I gritted my teeth and went in anyways. Where did all these come from?! Thankfully, in not too long, my body seemed to get used to the salty water and we had a great time trying to sink ourselves, a complete impossibility, and floating around. We learned that there used to be one company (more like a single person who runs a side hustle) that runs scuba dives in the Dead Sea and each diver needs around 100 pounds of weights to be able to sink below the surface. Not sinking is really an amazing feeling; especially for me who cannot tread water and had to cheat on my treading water portion of my swim test in order to take a sailing class in grad school. Tada! Now I can "tread water!" We both could basically stand straight up. Floating tummy-side down was, funnily enough, a challenge because my legs would shoot straight up into the air and nearly make me faceplant which was dangerous because getting even a single drop of salt water into the eyes would mean instant burning. We watched as one unsuspecting visitor decided to try to swim in the water and dove in with goggles and almost immediately lurched out and ran to the showers to flush out his eyes. Pro tip: have a bottle of fresh water right at the shore so that you can flush out your eyes immediately instead of running half-blindingly over to the showers which are at least one set of staircases away. The hotel also supplied Dead Sea mud that was sourced from the southern Dead Sea; there's a north and south Dead Sea that are separated by land (they used to be connected) but the south Dead Sea is not a place where one can visit as it is primarily used by companies that harvest bromine and potash there for export. The excessive harvesting is also one of the reasons why the Dead Sea is rapidly disappearing, its shoreline receding by about one meter each year. The Dead Sea mud might be one of the first "beauty" products that we've used that really lives up to the hype: we both generously slathered on the mud and sat on the edge of the lake, waiting for it to dry. Then we went into the lake to rinse it off and voila, we were both baby butt smooth. Apparently the oiliness of the lake also helps with the effect. For those (including us) wishing to replicate the effect at home, we learned that all exported "Dead Sea" products simply take the _salt_ harvested from the south Dead Sea and mix it with generic, mass produced mud. Easier to ship over just the salt, I guess. Alas, I guess we'll have to come back to Jordan one day!

Besides the Siq Trail in Wadi Mujib, we did a handful of other treks during our ten day road trip of Jordan. We did a gorgeous trek from Dana (our "amuse bouche" of the Jordan Trail) called Wadi Ghuweir that started in a town called Mansoura and ended in a small town called Feynan that used to be a hub for copper production and now has one of the most famous ecolodges in the world. The trail followed the shallow waters downstream and we enjoyed dipping into one of the natural pools where some of the river water congregated. We met a couple of women from Belgium in Wadi Rum earlier who suggested we take swimsuits and we ended up dipping into the wrong pool (there was a more obvious larger one later, but we didn't know exactly which pool they were talking about at the time), but it was still delightful. This wadi was especially unique for having palm trees growing off the walls of the canyon, leaning across the span of the gorge. The greenery against the red walls was stunning!

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images_4 %}

We also did another wadi hike, Wadi Al Hasa, on the way from the Dead Sea to Aqaba which was nearly completely deserted. We had a bit of a rough start as there were tons of flies and trash on the trail, but eventually we got far enough that the flies stopped bothering us. There were tons of flies near the Dead Sea (outside of the resort area) as well; we stopped to take some photos of the salt formations but I was sprinting both to and from the water's edge, wildly swinging around my camera to both take photos and swat flies at the same time. I've had to delete a lot of those insane angle photos. It was punishingly hot near Wadi Al Hasa though so we didn't end up spending too long. Fun fact: at 430 meters below sea level, it's harder to get sunburned because of the thickness of the atmosphere! Probably good anyways because I'm sure standard sunscreen has not been manufactured to withstand a body of water that is nine times saltier than the ocean. I have one particular bone to pick with many of the hikes that we did in Jordan though; people throw their trash on the ground! I got stabbed in the toe by a piece of trash towards the end of the Wadi Ghuweir hike (hey, at least it's not a needle) but in general, there's tons of bottles, plastic, wrappers, everything just floating around. It's so bad that Munthar, on seeing a plastic bag float through the air ahead of us, quipped "observe, our national bird of Jordan." The floating plastic bags seem particularly egregious to me. Esther again provided some perspective here though (she's a statistician) that once countries reach a certain threshold of GDP per capita, then putting trash into trash bins (and more generally, intentionally moving the country in a direction away from being a "pollution haven") will become more of a citizen's/government's concern. Below that, people have more pressing concerns than where to place their trash, which does make sense. There's been a lot of debate about this Environment's Kuznets Curve, but I found a [2024 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02639-9) that seemed to at least support the inverted U-shaped curve between economic growth and environmental degradation. Of course, as with a lot of stats, there are lots of nuances.

Wadi Rum is probably the second most famous place in Jordan after Petra and is known for its Mars-like landscapes with stunning red cliffs. We spent two nights in Wadi Rum with one of the days spent going around to different highlights of the desert while riding in the bed of a modified pickup truck. Here, we met two lovely Belgian women who gave us a bunch of excellent tips for our future Jordan plans. A Bedouin showed us around to different sites within Wadi Rum; he showed us a technique of scooching our butts up a narrow crack to climb up the walls to a nice shaded spot that _I think_ usually has a pool but at the time we were there, was just a flat of mud. On this excursion, we learned about exactly how sweet Bedouin tea is: the first tent where we got tea, we thought "oh that's pretty sweet, but tasty enough." The second cup was "oh my god, it's just sugar water." I had not quite learned this at this point yet, but many cups of sugar water were about to be a staple in my future. The Bedouins drink their tea right into the night (my Westernized brain remains horrified about the level of caffeine and sugar that is in the body as folks turn in for bed... how do they sleep?!) and it feels a bit disrespectful to turn down tea so we sipped and sipped the sugar water as slowly as we could. We ended this evening by hanging out in the sand, watching the sun set as our Bedouin guide boiled water, sugar, and leaves again for some evening cups of _shai_.

{% include slideshow.html images=page.slideshow_images_5 %}

Before we visited Wadi Rum, we made a short one day stop at the southern tip of Jordan in a city called Aqaba. Or "Aghabeh" if you're a man. In Arabic, words are pronounced differently based on your gender. Men pronounce the words more aggressively than women so the "k" sound becomes more like a "gh" and "a" becomes a grunt-like "eh." Aqaba is famous for being a great place for snorkeling and diving and we found a company that did a boat trip out to the Red Sea where you had a choice between snorkeling or diving, but both could be done at the same site. In Türkiye, Kevin had injured his ear while cliff jumping (our guess is that it was some sort of barotrauma) and diving in Mozambique unfortunately aggravated the injury even though we thought it had healed so we were looking for places where I could potentially dive and Kevin could snorkel. Luckily Aqaba was just the perfect location; the water visibility is 20+ meters so both of us could see things really well in the water. We got on a boat that was, again, nearly empty and the whole time we were lounging on the deck, we thought, oh I'm sure another large snorkeling group will show up. Nope, never did. I think I now understand the appeal of private yachts! There was just one other person who had a diving license on the boat and two others who were diving for the first time so each pair got a Divemaster. I was very lucky to dive with a guy, who originally was from the UK but currently living in East Jerusalem, who had done hundreds of dives before. I let both the Divemaster and him know it was my first dive post Open Water license so they were able to give me some great advice after each dive on how to improve (I'm currently really bad at staying in one spot while doing a three minute safety stop which isn't great because it sort of defeats the purpose of the safety stop) and were generally really encouraging. We got to snorkel/dive at two places: one which highlighted some amazing reefs that were actually teeming with wildlife and another which was a wreck site. The wreck site was a plane that people had intentionally sunk around thirty years ago after having a party. They had ripped out most of the interiors and picked a place where there was little reef to sink it. Since then, new reefs had started to grow on the plane and there were a bunch of lionfish hiding under the seats. I really enjoyed this wreck dive, especially swimming through the plane door and out one of the cavities where an engine used to be. A dummy skeleton had been placed in one of the bathrooms, which thankfully our Divemaster warned us about because I probably would have mildly freaked out and instead it was hilarious to see.

Our last two days on our road trip were spent driving from the Dana Biosphere Reserve up to Madaba and visiting the various churches and sights in Madaba. Driving the King's Highway was such a wonderful experience; the views are really stunning as the highway winds its way through the hills. Thankfully our car did well cruising up the mountains after the engine light came on on our first day with the car. One memorable stop was visiting the totally deserted Sela Castle which was populated as early as the Iron Age by Edomites. After visiting the ruins, we got a bit lost trying to figure out a way through what looked like a solid wall of rock and of course, there were no trails marked on Google Maps or Open Street Maps. Eventually, after some systematic depth first searching, we eventually found our way!

In Madaba, we had a bit of a change of culture with the city peppered with tons of churches. The most famous one was St. George's whose floor contains a [mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madaba_Map) that is the oldest map of the Holy Land from the 6th century. Seeing that was very cool and also, we visited even more churches with larger and more stunning mosaics, including the Madaba Archeological Park, Apostles Church, St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church, and the Church of St. Steven's (located not in Madaba, but in Umm ar-Rasas, another ancient Roman city). The mosaics are so beautiful! Too bad we don't make beautiful floors like this anymore! Our last stop before heading back to Amman was to visit Mount Nebo, which is a place mentioned in the Bible as the location where Moses saw Jerusalem. The summit has a nice church, also with beautiful mosaics, and the top has really lovely views looking out to West Bank.

</figcaption>

I actually really quite liked Madaba as a town. It felt a little more modern than Amman and we stayed at a great hotel with a young manager who was very easy to talk to and gave us a great recommendation for an amazing meal. We ate at the Carob House and had a meal with beer (gasp!) and had the most amazing _rashtayeh_ (lentils, soft noodles, tamarind-pomegranate molasses, crispy onions, and sautéed garlic and coriander all in a delicious heap), and black seed tahini ice cream on a cookie crumble. Yum! Thinking about it is making me hungry again. And once we returned to Amman, we beelined straight back to Hashem's for falafels and hummus and ful and to Habiba's for hot kunefe which we ate right on the street as it should. I've sworn off falafels and hummus for the rest of the trip, if I can manage, because I think I'll only have sad dry falafels from now on.

Phew, this was a long one (and this is with me glossing over the half dozen or so ancient cities we visited) but it's time to get this published since now we're in Bhutan (yes, it's taken me more than a week but I don't write linearly so I've got a good chunk of the Dana to Petra post written up... to be published another time!). I'll end by one last story which is that we had the cutest, clingiest cat at our last Airbnb in Amman. This cat showed up the day we arrived and would whine and whine at the door (but never came inside!) and so we fed the cat and gave it attention by sitting outside on a little table, doing planning and research outside. It didn't really want pets but it just wanted us to be near. And occasionally would just plop itself right down on my laptop while I was doing something and decide that that was the moment to partake in some self-care grooming. I miss that kitty. And all the other kitties that I couldn't resist petting and cuddling through my entire time in Amman. Kevin has _a lot_ of photos now of me and cats. Probably too many :)
