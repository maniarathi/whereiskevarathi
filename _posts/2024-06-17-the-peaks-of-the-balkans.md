I’m sitting on a fluffy wooden picnic table at our guesthouse in Milisevc, Kosovo typing out the first words here. The picnic table is fluffy because the house dog named Borë (which means “snow” in Albanian) looks like a Great Pyrenees that likes to use the wood to scratch himself. He’s left little bits of fluff all over the yard making it look like, well, snow. He was the first to welcome us by sticking his tongue out and promptly collapsing into the grass upon first pet to this… town? Village? I’m not sure what word to use to describe a small gathering of about ten log cabins. I can hear the jingle of the bells on the cows, I assume returning home, and Kevin and the guesthouse owner are in the midst of a losing battle against the water heater as they try to get hot water to come through the shower. They’re yelling at each other through the small bathroom window, checking the temperature of the water while the owner noodles around with the settings. I appreciate the optimism; I resigned myself to the ice bath earlier. The birds are loudly tweeting, a bee just sat on my shoulder with a loud buzz, and on either side of me, the Balkan peaks rise spectacularly into the sky.

Kevin and I are on day 5 of a multiday hike called the Peaks of the Balkans. The trail runs through the gorgeous Albanian Alps which are also called “Bjeshkët e Nëmuna” in Albanian and “Prokletije” in Serbian-Croatian which both translate to the “Accursed Mountains” in English. They cut across Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo. We were lucky to be able to do the trail at this time in early June; this past winter, there was very little snowfall and so the trail opened up a couple weeks earlier than normal. Usually at this time of the year, a few of the mountain passes would be closed but enough of the snow has melted that the trail was opened early. The trail has been incredibly quiet because it’s early; many of the shepherd villages that we have passed through haven’t been populated yet. The villages are impossible to get to in the winter, serviced by adventurous and often very faint 4WD tracks, so only during the summer time are these tiny towns filled with people offering up space in their homes as guesthouses or refreshments of tea, coffee, raki (the local liquor), or sometime coffee and raki. And sometimes coffee and raki at 7am. Most nights there are just us and perhaps two or three other people staying at the guesthouse, though we’ve run into some trekking groups as well. Tonight, it’s just us and another couple from Germany. Normally, many hikers skip the Kosovo section altogether because the entire trek takes nearly two weeks and the Kosovo section has a lot of asphalt hiking without much in the way of mountain views, so this stop is especially quiet. We’ll skip the other two stops of Kosovo as well as take car transfers for parts of the Montenegro section that are less exciting so our trek will take 8 days total.

After getting back to Tiranë, we departed for Shkodër which is the gateway to the hiking areas. Shkodër ended up being quite a bit more bustling and modern than we expected. It took us the good part of a day to take a bus from Tiranë, but we had some time to relax, prep our bags for the trek since we were leaving some unnecessary items in Shkodër, and check out the city. The downtown area was full of TVs set up to watch the Champions League final but instead of watching soccer, we visited a lovely photography museum and had an early dinner in town at a new spot that had only opened up a couple months prior. We wanted to head to bed early because not only were we transferring to the town that was the start of the hike, Theth, but we also had a warm up day hike that we wanted to be rested for.

**Day 0: Theth -> Syri e Kaltër “Blue Eye” -> Theth**

We started out day 0 with a car transfer from Shkodër to Theth. I was surprised when a Mercedes showed up outside our little hotel to take us there. I’m not sure but there seems to be a particular interest in Mercedes in Albania. It was brought up in a joke as a really sturdy and reputable car and there seems to be a quite high number of Benz on the road. Our driver was a very sweet man who also gifted us eight ripe nectarines as he expertly navigated the narrow switchbacks of the mountains to get to Theth. I was feeling a little nauseous by the end of the journey, but nothing a nectarine and some fresh air couldn’t fix.

After checking into our guesthouse for the night, we went off to do the Blue Eye hike. This hike really reminded me of hiking in the Picos; the valley that we hiked through was surrounded by tall limestone peaks that were still dotted with a touch of snow with the lower parts of the slopes overgrown by greenery. It was a long hike of nearly 20 kilometers roundtrip, but fairly flat. Plus once we reached the lake, we both leaped into the ice cold lake which was both brain freezing and as Kevin says, invigorating. After a sweaty hike, this time I agreed with him on the invigorating part!

We returned back to Theth to a dinner spread that truly terrified us. The food just kept coming and coming in vast quantities for just the two of us: vegetable soup, Greek salad, bread, grilled peppers and eggplants with a yogurt sauce, parboiled potatoes and peppers in a light tomato sauce, a plate of chicken, and two large hunks of cake for dessert. I was trying to hold in a gasp by the time they brought out the salad though my bugging eyes probably gave away my feelings; I really wasn’t sure what we would do with all this food on the table. Guess it was a good thing we had hiked so much! This wouldn’t be the last time that I would be nearly mouth gaping at the generosity of Balkan hospitality.

**Day 1: Theth -> Valbonë**

I was very glad that we had prior experience hiking with a backpack because holy macaroni did we start off with a bang. We hiked and panted over 16 kilometers with nearly 1200 meters of elevation gain (3800 feet). It was a good exercise using the GPX files that the company gave us because there were a couple of times that the trail that the company recommended slightly deviated from the official trek. We missed our turns a couple of times but caught it pretty quickly.

</figcaption>

This trek was quite populated. While it’s one of the first ones that you can do on the Peaks trek, it’s also popular as a single night overnight trek (Theth -> Valbonë -> Theth) or you can do it as a day hike up to the mountain pass and back to Theth. We remembered exactly how much our pace slows down with packs on our backs and by the time we reached the mountain pass, Valbonë pass, I was cursing everything from the six nectarines being so ripe and juicy for the added weight to the Accursed Mountains themselves that were causing me pain everywhere from my shoulders, knees, big toes, feet, butt, arms, quads, and countless other body parts. It was worth it though. I’ll add pictures below of the stunning panoramic views that we got from the first “peak.” The view of the valley with the mountains rising on either side was unbelievable, even with the slightly cloudy skies.

Once we were over the pass, the crowds subsided substantially. We made our way to our guesthouse for the evening that was situated at the foot of the mountains. We watched the sun fading away on the limestone from the front yard and ate another ton of food before heading off to an early sleep.

**Day 2: Valbonë -> Çerem**

Çerem is pronounced “cherem.” I have been doing a poor job of learning the sounds of the Albanian language and so I keep getting surprised by the names of the places we are hiking to. I’ve at least learned now that the “ë” is pronounced like the short a in English. I _think_ that with the “gj” combo, you just drop the “g” and pronounce it like the English “j.” I’m doomed with names like “Zllonopoje.”

![](assets/img/the-peaks-of-the-balkans/P6040016_Original.jpeg)

This was one of the toughest days of the entire trek. There are two options to getting from Valbonë to Çerem, the “low pass” and the “high pass.” We did the high pass with over 1200 meters (almost 4000 feet) of elevation gain. This hike was genuinely tough as we had to scramble over the rocky terrain. After the hardest bits though, we got to enjoy some time in the beautiful meadows that were overflowing with white and yellow flowers. The views, of course, were absolutely stunning. One of my favorite features of this hike was standing inside the “Ice Wind Cave” which was a small cave that apparently stays around zero degrees all the time. It was genuinely as cold as a freezer and we used the cave as a stop to cool off from our climb and reapply sunscreen on non-sweaty skin.

At this point in the trek, the crowds were gone. For most of this day’s hike, we were on our own except for a few other people that we ran into during the slow rocky ascent. It was incredibly peaceful throughout the hike; I don’t say “quiet” because the birds were making an absolute ruckus and there were plenty of bugs and insects buzzing around. By the time we approached Guesthouse Afrimi, where we would spend the night, we could hear the clanging of the bells on cows, horses neighing, and roosters cockadoodle-dooing as if they’re choking to death. This place would be such a good place to teach babies all sorts of different animal noises.

We loved staying at Guesthouse Afrimi. The place was very rustic, but the wife of the place warmly welcomed us with her limited English and fed us extremely well. Her young son toddled around saying something repeatedly in Albanian and giggled as he threw water on himself and got his sweater all wet. I had to quickly escape the scene because I was laughing with him at his delight and maybe that was encouraging him a little too much. There were just four of us staying the night and we loved the delicious spread that was offered for dinner. It’s extremely easy to be vegetarian on this trek and the food is unbelievably fresh and delicious. Everything appears to be local; we saw bee boxes that produce the honey served to us at breakfast, the tomatoes and cucumbers that are offered to us for all three meals are still on their vines (the garden is adjacent to the guest house) and taste incredible even without salt or pepper, the soft cheeses (similar to feta) are made from the dairy cows we pass by our hikes, and the eggs are from the chickens that I accidentally frightened by walking too closely by. The fig jam is homemade, the butter, yogurt, and sour cream are all homemade, and bread is baked fresh in huge rolls, also homemade. And absolutely everything is delicious. We have not had one bad meal on this trek though perhaps we will fatigue of cucumber, tomato, cheese sandwiches with a hard boiled egg by the end of 8 days.

**Day 3: Çerem -> Dobërdoll**

This was a really fun day. After two pretty tough days, this day was much less intense with a relatively shallow ascent to the peak of our hike for the day. We crossed into Montenegro and hiked through some of their forested areas before heading back into Albania, with gorgeous views of the mountains all along the way. Crossing borders here is completely uneventful; one of the border crossings was marked with a stone, but there are no checkpoints or really anything at all. We learned that this hike even _existing_ at all is an achievement. For many years, there have been border disputes in these areas, between Albania and Yugoslavia, and after Yugoslavia broke up in 1992, border conflicts between Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo got really bad. Kosovo is split between two ethnical groups: one that identifies themselves as primarily Albanian and are largely Muslim religiously and another that identifies as Serbian/Montenegrin and who identify as Christian Orthodox. In a nutshell, that absolutely does not do the conflict any historical justice, the two groups engaged in back and forth of mass forced migration, expelling the other out of Kosovo at various times and/or being sent to concentration camps. For a period of time, the conflict was muted because of peacekeeping groups that cataloged any skirmishes, but after those groups left, the conflict escalated into a full blown war in 1998. The conflict ended with a controversial intervention by NATO with a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, followed by the formal Kumanovo ceasefire agreement. So the areas that we hiked through were once heavily patrolled and areas that civilians could not go. The trek itself is somewhat of a political olive branch as the full Peaks of the Balkans trail is equally split, mileage-wise, between the three countries. The trek has existed for only 11 years and we were warned that many of the locals have suffered and/or lost loved ones and so restraint should be shown when discussing any strong political opinions.

<figcaption>

We had a tea break here. The gardens are in the process of being replaced by guest houses.

</figcaption>

Due to one particular bench that was perfectly placed with a panoramic view of the mountains that we reached right around our lunch time, we met some really nice folks during our long lunch break. We met an energetic and talkative duo from Ireland and Kosovo who were doing the full trek for a second time (last year being their first) and told us about how much the trek had changed even over one year. They waved us down later on during our hike this day to join them for a cup of tea and mentioned that they had tea at the exact same spot last year and so many new buildings had cropped up. We believed this; there is so much active building that is taking place in all the tiny villages with more and more guesthouses and cabins being built to accommodate the boom in popularity. Occasionally, in the idyllic noise of the chirping birds and buzzing bees, we could also hear the squealing of machine tools from small villages in the valleys. I could imagine that even in two or three years, this trek could feel very different with fancier accommodation, 4WD tracks to bring in goods from more major cities, and many more coffee/bar shops that offer refreshments along the hike. It really brings me mixed feelings; the trek as it is today is incredible with its remoteness and very homely accommodations. At the same time, there’s definitely the demand for new fancy accommodations and comfort and it’s an incredible economic opportunity for the folks who live here. I hope that there are certain parts of the area that turn into more protected national parks so that both can exist in harmony (only the Montenegro side is a national park).

![](assets/img/the-peaks-of-the-balkans/P6050023_Original.jpeg)

We also met Martin and Silas who we’d run into again the next day. Martin was from Germany and was hiking the trek on his own. Silas, from England, was on a crazy journey to walk from England to India. He spends around 100 days a year hiking to try to achieve his goal and was passing through a part of the Peaks of the Balkans trail to try to make it to Kosovo.

After our tea break, we passed through some more beautiful forested areas with gorgeous pink flowers before we saw Doberdol in sight where we would spend two nights. We dined with three other folks this evening: a couple from Holland who we happened to have seen in our same accommodations in Theth as well as a man from the south of France who was doing a combination of camping but eating and showering at the guesthouses. Because it is possible to do wild camping here, there were quite a number of folks who carried their own tent and would just pickup food at the guesthouses.

**Day 4: Gjeravica Peak**

A day without our packs! We hiked to the tallest peak in Kosovo called Gjeravica Peak but since we started and ended in Dobërdoll, we were able to just carry a single day pack between the two of us which meant that for half the hike, each one of us had absolutely nothing to carry. Honestly, it felt like we were flying.

![](assets/img/the-peaks-of-the-balkans/P6060003_Original.jpeg)

<figcaption>

No packs!

</figcaption>

This hike was fairly straightforward both in terms of route finding and not having too many crazy climbs except for the last bit to get to the summit. We did accidentally go over the wrong pass to exit Dobërdol valley but it all connected up to the main trail on the other side so it was fine. I was confused when we lost Martin who decided to also spend an extra night in Dobërdol and hike the peak after talking to us and was on a similar pace as us but he went over the right pass.

Up and over Ali Peja pass.

</figcaption>

On the other side of the Ali Peja Pass, we walked primarily along the ridge before the final push to the summit. We had to walk across a few of the remaining snowfields, but nothing too crazy. I could easily understand how this area would be completely impassable during the winter. The entire ridge would be covered in many feet of snow. This ridge also used to be the border between Albania and Yugoslavia so not too long ago, the hike that we did used to be a heavily patrolled area as well. I suppose, much like the borders in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, that mountains are easy ways to define natural borders.

We also met up with Silas both while hiking and later at the summit (his pace was much faster than ours). Taking the extra day to do this hike was absolutely worth it. The 360 views from the top were stunning and we got a lovely view down of the city of Uck in Kosovo. At the summit, the Albanian flag was flying even though the peak is undeniably in Kosovo. We found the Kosovo flag stashed away in a box that also contained a book with notes from previous hikers. Silas, having spent four months in Albania, told us that the older generation still believes that parts of Kosovo still belong to Albania so the flag replacement was somewhat unsurprising. The younger generation, he said, seems to be mostly fatigued with the back and forth and do not care as much about border disputes.

It’s funny how quickly it becomes sad to say goodbye to people that we’ve met for literally just a few hours. We said our goodbyes to both Silas, who was going to attempt to trek into the valley on the other side of the peak’s ridge into a proper border crossing in Kosovo, and Martin who was staying in a different guesthouse and going to a different destination the following day. We returned back to our triangle cabin and as per usual, a mountain of food.

**Day 5: Dobërdol -> Milisevc**

We had a lovely hike through the Scottish Highland-esque greenlands getting out of Dobërdol. One of the highlights of this hike was dropping our packs and climbing up to the “3 Borders Peak” which, as the name suggests, is a point where Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo meet. The views at the top were so pretty! This hike was not too difficult in terms of elevation gain or loss so we really had a nice time meandering through the forests and through some shepherd villages before reaching Milisevc.

View from the top of 3 Borders Peak.

The final stretch of the hike was walking past the largest shepherd village in the area called Roshkodol. It was interesting; Roshkodol is not a stop on the Peaks of the Balkans trail but there were lots of huge houses spread across a large area and we passed by many construction sites. My hypothesis is that this area is more for the locals who build their summer mountain homes here. Later this evening, the owner of the guest house we stayed at said that the people who stay in the mountains during the summer are passionate about maintaining the mountain culture so if anyone from Kosovo wants to spend a weekend or some time in the mountains, they do not need to pay to stay at a guest house and are treated like family.

![](assets/img/the-peaks-of-the-balkans/P6070029_Original.jpeg)

</figcaption>

Staying at this guest house was one of our favorite experiences. With almost all the other guest houses, we didn’t have too much interaction with the owners besides checking in, maybe a little at dinner time when they brought out food, and when checking out. At Bujtina (“guest house”) Lojza, the family joined us (plus the other German couple that was staying the night) in the living room after dinner for some chit chat. Their 13 year old son nicknamed “Son” taught us how to play a card game called “Tunge” which is an adaptation of a card game called “[Te Rrethi](https://hellofromkosovo.com/2017/08/07/learn-how-to-play-te-rrethi-a-card-game/)” in Kosovo. Kevin played some chess with the husband. Son told us that he wanted to become a guide or a pharmacist (like his mom) when he grew up. We were told that their guest house had been their mountain house even before the trail existed and they had just added some cabins and guest rooms to accommodate trekkers (Son and his dad had just finished building a beautiful wooden bed earlier that day that they proudly showed off). They get up to 25 guests a night in the peak season which must be crazy since the guest house is pretty small. We got a glimpse of some of the ethnic divide of Kosovo as the husband was very passionate about his desire to maintain Albanian culture and specifically considered himself and his family to be Kosovo Albanians. I didn’t realize how close it was to get to the nearest city where the family lives most of the year; it was less than 20 kilometers away though it takes about an hour and a half to get there. Learning all this and more about the family and their way of life was really nice and something I didn’t expect to experience while trekking.

**Day 6: Milisevc -> Babino Polje**

This day was a blissfully short and easy day, though quite an adventure with route finding. On the classic Peaks of the Balkans trek, if someone treks to Milisevc, they usually continue on to the next stop in Kosovo. Per our itinerary’s guidance, we instead shortcutted back into Montenegro via a lightly trodden path. We missed a turn about five minutes into the hike and had to backtrack when Son, who was watching us from the guest house, yelled at us that we were going the wrong way. A little bit further along the trail, I got ourselves in a bit of a pickle when I led us down a trail that seemed to end at a steep slope. I precariously sidestepped/stomped across to cross the small stream in the gulch while Kevin, more practically, backtracked a bit to find a slightly higher route. No surprise, that was also a wrong turn, we realized after scrambling up on the other side to meet up with the real trail. Even when we were on trail, according to our GPS, the pine trees smacked our limbs, the brush was overgrown and scratching our legs (I was so thankful that I randomly decided to wear my leggings today instead of usual shorts), and at one point towards the end of the hike, it felt like we were just making our own path down the tall grass of the meadow guessing at which places might have been recently trodden down by human hoofs. I had my Garmin going so it was yelling at me every few minutes when we inadvertently went off trail and then again when we rediscovered the trail again.

We had fewer views of the mountains, though we enjoyed the change of scenery hiking through the dense pine forests and then through the blooming meadows with white, yellow, pink, purple, and blue flowers. After the steep descent through the meadows, we made it uneventfully to the guesthouse which was situated abut a gurgling stream. While the guesthouse was definitely quite antisocial (we got placed on a separate couch away from the other guests who were a large-ish group of French speakers), this might have been our favorite room with two floors that looked out over the stream and mountains beyond. Unfortunately, we had a family of six or seven wasps hanging out on the top floor that we weren’t able to shoo out, but we comfortably slept on the bottom floor and, drum roll, THE SHOWER WAS HOT. I was absolutely elated.

**Day 7: Grebaje Valley**

This was another “easy” day with little mileage (~9 kilometers) but approximately 1100 meters of elevation gain. Unusually, we began our day by first taking a car transfer from Babino Polje to Grebaje Valley which is not part of the traditional Peaks of the Balkans route. In fact, Grebaje Valley is pretty accessible if one is visiting Montenegro generally; there are decent roads from larger towns like Plav and Gusinje (also called Vusanje). This meant that for the first time in a while, there were actually lots of people on the trail and most of them were day hikers who were staying a few days in one of the nearby town villages.

Sheep traffic jam. Though let’s be honest, the car was in the way of the sheep, not the other way around.

After getting dropped off at the trailhead, we decided to see if we could drop off our packs somewhere instead of hauling them up and down the peaks we were about to climb. We were going to have another car transfer pick us up in the late afternoon again from the trailhead to whisk us away to Vusanje so we didn’t _need_ to carry our packs. We found a little hut close by with a kind husband and wife who let us drop off our packs and refused payment. So off we went, with just a daypack up not just one, but three peaks for a “lollipop” hike.

The hike was wonderful. It was a bit hazy so we couldn’t quite see all the mountains far out, but standing on the peaks placed us directly facing the sheer limestone spears of the Accursed Mountains which was very cool. We were really glad we did this deviation from the normal route.

This was a genuinely yummy Montenegrin beer and of course, delightfully cold after hiking.

</figcaption>

After getting into Vusanje, we ran into two familiar faces from earlier on in our trek: a sibling duo from the UK. We enjoyed hanging out with a fairly social group of folks at dinner while again, the food just kept coming, and of course, after everyone had sipped through a shot of raki, became even more social. Kevin and I plus the UK siblings passed a couple more hours away with a deck of cards and we slept extremely well.

**Day 8: Vusanje -> Theth**

Three for three, I have always felt bittersweet ending a multi day trek. Physically, I feel like my body has adapted to carrying a pack and being able to walk for miles on end (and eat way more food), but at the same time, I had some bruises on my collarbones that I was eager to provide some relief to. Mentally, I’m sad to have the days spent in the beautiful mountains come to an end but also looking forward to what’s to come (Istanbul!). Also, I had perfected the crafting of my lunch sandwich which was to pilfer breakfast leftovers like roasted peppers and various spreads to amend my classic tomato and cheese sandwich. I now eat cucumbers raw like a rabbit. In any case, day 8 did not leave much time for mulling anything over. It was the longest day yet with around 22 kilometers and 1300 meters of steep, “knee-crunching” downhill that I knew would be tough for my “runner’s knees.” But! Apparently the most spectacular views of the Accursed Mountains yet!

![](assets/img/the-peaks-of-the-balkans/P6100100_Original.jpeg)

The route notes were not wrong. As we walked across dried up lake beds, over mountain passes, through meadows, alongside abandoned military compounds and bunkers, it was really a grand finale of the Accursed Mountains. It was _windy_ as we passed through the valley but very welcome to combat the sweat as we made our way over the final pass before 3.3 kilometers to drop down over 1000 meters. Kevin had been carrying around a pack of Walkers’ shortbread that we picked up in Tiranë and we’d been slowly eating them as a special treat during or after hiking. That was something we had done during the O trek when we brought with us a dozen cookies from our favorite cookie shop in El Calafate. We had our last bits of shortbread about halfway down the steep ascent, looking out onto the valley where Theth resides.

And that was it! We suddenly emerged into civilization and trudged to the visitors center at exactly 5pm on the dot where our punctual ride was waiting for us to take us back to Shkodër. That night, we demolished a pizza the size of a dinner table and a couple beers. It’s hard to believe that we’ve ended up spending 3 weeks in Albania and as we stared at a map of Albania that was hanging up at the airport, we felt like we did a pretty good job of covering the country, maybe aside from the eastern part. We are really really glad we came here and would highly recommend this country with its rich history, picture-perfect beaches, unbelievable hiking, all with the incredible kindness and generosity of the Albanian people. Next stop: Turkey!
