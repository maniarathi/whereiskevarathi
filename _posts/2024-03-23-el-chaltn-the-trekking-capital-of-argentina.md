After the O trek, we took a bus from Puerto Natales back to El Calafate and then onwards to El Chaltén, the trekking capital of Argentina. We weren’t (or I should really say “aren’t” given that I’m sitting here writing after a 24km hike earlier today but that’s for another day) done hiking quite yet! The wonderful thing about hiking in Chaltén is that a car really isn’t very necessary; most of the trailheads are walking distance from any place within town (~1-2 kilometers). The town is pretty tiny as well, with just two major roads that host all its shops and housing.

A fun fact that I learned only recently about Chaltén is that the main peak, Fitz Roy, was originally called Chaltén meaning “smoking mountain.” People thought that Fitz Roy was a volcano because it was frequently covered in clouds (something we can attest to as well!). It was renamed after an English officer later on.

After bopping around from one location to the next every day for almost two weeks, staying in El Chaltén in one Airbnb for a full week was a welcome change. It afforded us a couple of rest days while we waited out the weather as well. El Chaltén, more than any other location to date, definitely felt like we fit in very well. The town is filled with backpackers roaming the streets with clinking hiking poles or meters of rope slung across their shoulders (for rock climbing). Anyone who had a rolling suitcase struggled as they dragged/carried their luggage across the rocky uneven roads.

This picture is actually from our second to last day in Chaltén, one of two when we got a perfect view of Fitz Roy.

Our first day in Chaltén was mostly a catch-up-on-chores day; we’ve roughly settled on a cadence of having one day each week that is dedicated to knocking off chores and this was the day. But, we also managed to sneak in a small hike to a nearby waterfall that was a really nice way to cap off the day: Chorillo del Salta. The waterfall was really cute, but the views of the delta that sat right beyond the town were really cool from the ridge we walked along.

The following day, we did perhaps the most iconic and popular hike in all of Argentina: Laguna de Los Tres. The hike takes you to a lake that sits at the base of the famous Fitz Roy peak (originally named Mount Chaltén). Unfortunately, when we got to the lake, Fitz Roy (and most of the surrounding mountains) were covered with low clouds. On the flip side, low clouds, misty rain, and the occasional sun peeping through breaks in the clouds created many rainbows throughout the hike. The most stunning was a rainbow that arched right over the entire town of Chaltén as we hiked back.

Hidden behind the clouds is Fitz Roy, but unfortunately we couldn’t see the peaks today. The lake was still very pretty though!

After Los Tres, was another bad weather day; apparently Chaltén has had a rough time this summer with non-ideal weather and it was no different while we were in town. However, the second half of the day cleared out and we decided to try a bit of rock climbing! This was my first time ever rock climbing and honestly, I didn’t expect to climb more than a few feet off the ground. But, we both climbed four pitches and had a really great time. It was really fun to try out something new and with every pitch, I was a bit more trusting of the rope and my own legs and arms.

We did two more hikes after rock climbing day (in two days): Laguna Torre and Loma del Pliegue. We lucked out with wonderful weather both days and we finally got our first clear view of Fitz Roy on the way back from Laguna Torre. The extra hike to Mirador Maestri from Laguna Torre revealed a field of icebergs that had chunked off of Grande glacier which you couldn’t see from the base of the lake. Laguna Torres especially made me in awe of the impressive climbing feats that have been done in the area: you can see the snow covered tips of the famous Torre peak, Fitz Roy, and all the satellite peaks. I learned that in 2014, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell completed the first ever “traverse” climb of the Fitz Roy peak and satellite peaks that make up the famous ridge line.

Loma del Pliegue was a perfect way to end the series of hikes we did in Chaltén. We started the hike before dawn assuming that the hike would be really intense given that it was a uphill climb of over 1100 meters. In the end, the hike was actually quite mild given that the slope was gradual but consistent, but we were treated to a gorgeous sunrise with the sun shining directly on Fitz Roy as we walked over to the trail head.

On this hike, we came across our first sighting of wild cows. Apparently when the national park was created, the government asked the folks on the land to move out who had been raising cattle. They did move out, but left their cows behind and so now the descendants of those cows roam freely in the national park (also creating a bit of havoc on the grass by munching on it endlessly).

At the top of the climb, we were at an elevation that was higher than any of the previous hikes and so we could look down to Laguna Torre and some of the other lakes. There was a little bonus hike that was straight up a hill that AllTrails showed from the mirador; we navigated the snowy top of the hill (hiking in snow still is quite the adventure!) and got 360 degree views of not only the lakes but also the lakes and more flatlands behind us that we had just hiked through.

We had some other non-hiking highlight from Chaltén including meeting up with a couple other folks from the O trek for dinners (they coincidently happened to also be in Chaltén at the same time) and had a fancy tasting menu our last day (a nice change from endless pasta dishes that we’ve been typically eating when we go out). We really loved our time in Chaltén and would love to come back one day (maybe to try a multi-pitch climb which my guide seemed to think I could actually do!). But also like our climbing guide, it was time for us to try to escape the quickly arriving winter weather and hop north to Bariloche for… even more hiking :) But that’s for another day!

**Favorite hikes**:

1. Loma del Pliegue: bonus about this hike is that it is way less popular than the other two and so you finally get some moments where you’re alone in nature and maybe with some wild cows.

2. Laguna Torres and Laguna de Los Tres: must dos even though the trails are very crowded. They really do end with some of the most iconic views of Argentinian Andes peaks. Be prepared for serious crowds in the last kilometer of Los Tres because it is a bit scramble-y and steep which means the crowds bottleneck on that area.

**Favorite other things**:

1. [This health food store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XAkunqUHqnkwuFwZ6?g_st=ic): more than other places so far, we had a hard time finding groceries at the standard supermarket store to cook dinners. We stumbled on this store while visiting the post office and it was stocked with wonderful finds like hummus (“mousse de garbanzo”), unique condiments, calafate jam, peanut butter (we polished off an entire contained in a week), and the freshest vegetables.

2. [The Asadores](https://maps.app.goo.gl/trxXYmJwvfRdqwao6?g_st=ic): we had a delicious tasting menu at this restaurant which might be the only “fancy” restaurant in all of Chaltén.

3. [La Vinería](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ttuwVA8XFhcc8yXe8?g_st=ic): this is technically a bar, but we visited during the day to pick from their excellent selection of wines. We had a wonderful Malbec which was probably our favorite wine (bottle) we’ve had in Argentina to date.

4. A toaster oven: our Airbnb had a toaster oven and we picked up a box cookie mix and had warm gooey cookies almost every day. It was such a treat!
