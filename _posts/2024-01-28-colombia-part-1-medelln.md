Parque de las Luces used to be the site of one of the most dangerous areas of Medellín and has now been transformed into a lighted artificial “forest.”

I’m sitting here, on the floor, in our largely empty apartment in Toronto waiting for someone drop by to take away our dining table (the last of my working surfaces… although I suppose I could always stand and use the kitchen countertops!) and was reminiscing on our recent Colombian travel and figured, why not have the first bit of writing on this site reflect our South American amuse-bouche? _Technically_, it isn’t part of our “year of travel” plans, but I had left my job by then anyways so who’s really counting?

This year, during the holidays, we traveled to Colombia with my (Arathi’s) family. It was a welcome reprieve from the cold, dry days of wintery Toronto. Neither of us have ever been to South America before and we intend to spend a good chunk of 2024 in South America (that’ll be our starting continent) and so it was quite exciting for us to be able to get a brief sense of how our travels might begin.

We started our Colombian vacation in Medellín, a city that is nestled between Andes Mountains. The drive from the airport to the city is largely through a tunnel that runs through the mountains; you land in a pond of airplanes, go through tunnel and pop out the other end in city. Of course Medellín is unfortunately probably most well known for its associations with the drug cartels from the 70s and 80s but the city seems to be working hard to rebuild itself and become a welcoming place for tourists. On the walking tour we did (strongly recommend [this company](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MUcX3AUB3SURs2n56)!), I found it interesting that they really don’t seem to shy away from acknowledging how terrible those times were, how things are still not great in many ways, but are on an upward trend. We had a fabulous guide who took us around the city, showing us both the remnants of the past and the budding new. Courtesy of our wonderful tour guide, I learned about the “papaya levels” of safety which I will absolutely be using in my everyday life henceforth. Papaya level 1 means the area is chill; you can relax and leave your things out and most likely it won’t be stolen. Papaya level 5 though… you’d better be vigilant for pickpockets and keep your belongings close by. He’d call out various numbers of “papayas” based on the area in which we were walking.

In Medellín, we had our first tastes of beautiful graffiti art (there is so much in Colombia!), delicious food, and Colombia’s vibrant and playful culture. We visited [Comuna 13](https://maps.app.goo.gl/evpkeXTSQT6C4TXb6) which is the only place in the world where I have seen _escalators_ to go up a mountain and we saw our first of many Botero sculptures. I cannot remember the last time an artist’s work had me laughing at nearly every piece; they are absolutely comical and we had a blast visiting the Botero museum in Bogotá at the end of our trip.

I gotta run now but this was fun! I’ll write more about the other parts of Colombia at another point in time so I’ll fill up some more of this post with more pictures of Medellín.
