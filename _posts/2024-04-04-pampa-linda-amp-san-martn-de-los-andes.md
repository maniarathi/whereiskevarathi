Originally we had planned to stay in Bariloche for about a half a week and then move on to the Chilean side of northern Patagonia. At this point, we’re working on a bit of a deadline — Kevin has to fly to Vienna on May 5th for a conference. It’s been a helpful checkpoint for us to be able to plan more efficiently, but at times we’ve also had to start putting some places on a “future visit” list which is hard to believe given that we’re traveling for a _year_. I guess no matter how much time one has, there’s always even more to see and do!

Visiting Pampa Linda is probably the first major tradeoff we had to make and also something that we were able to do because of our extended travel time. We had learned about a particular viewpoint (or “mirador”) that was one of the best in Argentina (according to a random Reddit post), but it required a) a really nice day to actually see the view point, b) somewhat complex coordination of getting to and from the park because the road turns one way in the to or from direction at certain hours in a day. After learning about this mirador, we decided to extend our time in Bariloche by another day, used it to wait out heavy rain and catch up on errands, and then took another three days to visit Pampa Linda and do this hike to “Mirada del Doctor.” In return, we decided to tradeoff both the Otto Meiling hike (we’ll come back one day for that!) and cut a day from our road trip in Chilean Patagonia. Spoiler alert: it was absolutely worth it.

Pampa Linda is a tiny town that is nestled a the valley surrounded by the Patagonian mountains and most majestically, Cerro Tronador. It’s about 2 hours by car, southwest of Bariloche. It has essentially one place to stay: Hosteria Pampa Linda, that is run by a family who are descendants of José Emanuel Vereertbrugghen who was the first public doctor of Argentina and happened to love the area and built this hosteria. It’s a really quaint but comfortable place with hot showers, homely food, and really friendly and helpful staff.

We drove in our after our rainy day in Bariloche, which also happened to be another rainy day but not quite as heavy. Only about a half hour of the drive was on paved roads and the remainder was on gravel; our experience with driving on gravel roads from Namibia 3 years ago came in handy and we had no issues with the roads (I remember only stalling the car once and that was closer to Bariloche when I tried to push the car on a steep gravel uphill in third gear. Oops!). There is only one way into Pampa Linda (using Ruta 82) and there are particular hours that you can travel in one direction or other: from 10:30am-2pm you can only travel to Pampa Linda, from 4pm-6pm you can travel only out of Pampa Linda, and then from 7pm-9am the following day, the road is two-ways.

As we got to Pampa Linda and settled in, the weather cleared out a bit so we decided to do a short hike nearby to just stretch our legs. We didn’t have very high hope about the hike because it was rated 3.5 stars on AllTrails but we figured it would be nice to at least get some exercise after two days of relatively sedantry life.

This short trail was amazing! There were zero other people on this trails and at the top we could see down far into the valley. Because the weather was just clearing up, we were also treated to beautiful rainbows that kept appearing and disappearing as the low cloud drifted through the valley. I’m going to have to make sure to add my own 5 star review to AllTrails for this hike as it easily was worth the short uphill climb. Also maybe a note that some of the log bridges are slippery as on the way down, I slipped off of one of the logs and fell into a muddy stream. No matter — this is why I have two pairs of hiking pants :)

After returning to the hosteria and cleaning ourselves (well, mostly me) up, we found that the staff had reserved “la mejor mesa” (the best table) in the dining room for us with a stunning view of Tronodor. We ate our dinner watching the sun go down and a foal galloping around the front yard while the older horses serenely munched their own dinner of fresh grass. We capped off our dinner with a piece of yummy apple strudel and cream that was made using a recipe handed down from the Vereertbrugghen family.

The next day was our biggest hiking day yet: 24 kilometers to Mirada del Doctor. The Mirada is supposedly named after a German doctor named Jakob who spent a lot of time hanging out at the spot. I think that usually folks will do the hike as an overnight trek, staying at Refugio Ilon which we passed along the way, but we didn’t have quite the time and we were confident that we could do the mileage in a day. We also were staying one more night in Pampa Linda so we had all of the day to just hike and do nothing else. 

Both the Mirada and the stop at Laguna Ilon (next to Refugio Ilon) were stunning. It’s hard to put into words exactly how gorgeous this hike was so I’ll stop typing here and just add pictures below. We’re very grateful that the weather forecast that we bet on was spot on and we enjoyed both the views and the hike itself in warm, still air. There were very few people at the Mirada which allowed us nearly a full hour to enjoy the sight.

We started the hike before sunrise and got a lovely view of Cerro Tronodor with the sun shining right on it with Cascada Garganta del Diablo flowing on the right.

It was frosty in the morning which made for some really cool scenery along the “pampas” (plains) as we walked through.

We passed by Laguna Ilon which was incredibly still in the morning. It made an almost perfect reflection of Tronodor. Kevin took a quick dip in the lake on the way back which was extremely cold and also very shallow.

Some really cool ice formations alongside the trail from the morning frost. These all disappeared by the time we departed from the Mirada and hiked back down.

Mirada del Doctor. The weather was warm and still and we enjoyed a full hour of this view including lunch and (for me) a quick nap.

We actually did do the hike :)

The following day was another roadtrip day, from Pampa Linda, all the way past Bariloche to San Martín. From Bariloche to San Martín, we did the famous Ruta 40 Seven Lakes drive that really showcases why the area of Bariloche is called the “lake district.” Unfortunately, the weather turned rainy again (we knew that we’d have to give up our nice day for the Mirada), but we still enjoyed taking the day to leisurely drive from Pampa Linda to San Martín. Some of the highlights of this day include being greeted by a purring kitchen at 7am in Pampa Linda, enjoying a delicious sandwich and “chocolate caliente” in the rainy weather in Villa La Angostura (which has nothing to do with the Angostura bitters), briefly checking out the cinnamon colored trees in Parque Nacional Los Arrayanes (the smallest of all the national parks in Argentina), and hilariously ending our 7 lakes drive with the low clouds really settling in and fully obscuring the lake entirely (we had a good laugh with the folks from another car also doing the 7 lakes drive that we had previously run into at different lake stops). We spent the night in San Martín, a picturesque small town that had a surprisingly high end vibe with expensive boutique shops and stores.

We spent one and a half more days in San Martín, catching up on a few life items (like laundry) and also doing one more hike in the area: Cerro Colorado. We drove our car through more gravel roads to a hike that took us to possibly the windiest peak I have ever experienced. There was a small curved wall that had been built with the rock that I huddled in to switch out the lenses for my camera and then dashed out to quickly take some pictures while the wind literally pushed me around. Thankfully some of these snaps actually turned out pretty well!

Battling the winds!

Finally our last half day (before our bus to Pucón, Chile) we strolled around San Martín, strolled around town and skipped rocks by the lake. It was a Sunday and the power had gone out (it seemed like a regular occurrence as many shops were well-prepared and busted out their generators) so there wasn’t much to do. Honestly, the slower pace and warm sun was welcome before our 4 hour bus ride. One day, we’d love to return either in the peak of summer to do more water activities like kayaking or standup paddleboarding by the lake (the town reminded us of some of the towns near Lake Tahoe in that respect) or visit during the wintertime to see how it transforms into a ski town! And with that, we ended our time in Argentina (for the most part — we’ll come back briefly to Salta and Mendoza at the end of April) and moved on to Chile!
