I’m currently on Easter Island (Rapa Nui) sitting at a narrow wooden counter, thinking about Pucón for this blog post. Kevin and I have been traveling for 2 months now and somehow, we’ve ended up spending the majority of that time in the Patagonias. It’s almost a little bittersweet to sit here and write this post, because those days in Pucón and Puerto Varas were the last days that we spent in those mountains. I remember taking off from the Temuco airport towards Santiago and feeling melancholy about leaving the mountains as I craned my neck to glimpse the last volcano vistas of the area. Neither of us expected to spend the better part of 8 weeks in the mountains but boy, the Patagonias truly enraptured us with their beauty, their variation, and their majesty. As we’ve been mentioning to folks throughout Santiago and Rapa Nui that we’ve been traveling for so long, I’ve enjoyed how nearly every Chilean will ask first “have you visited Patagonia?” One cannot visit either Chile or Argentina without paying the mountains a visit and we would recommend that everyone put Patagonia on their travel bucket list.

The first thing I can remember about our time in the Chilean side of Northern Patagonia is the bus ride to Pucón. In Bariloche, we acquired a cooler at a liquidation sale we stumbled upon so that we could have sandwich supplies and snacks on hand while we road tripped and to reduce our waste as well — we often had to throw away extra food that we had bought at a grocery store because it was tough to continue to carry it forward. We were a bit nervous about how the cooler would do in the cargo area of the bus given the bumpy gravel roads the bus would have to travel down, but the cooler performed admirably and kept its lid on and the items inside cool! The bus ride over from San Martín to Pucón really highlighted the changing landscape between Argentina and Chile — namely the appearance of volcanoes! We had a fabulous view of Volcán Lanín as we crossed the border. After we finished immigration and customs into Chile, I sat on the curb of the road thinking what a crazy combination: I’m at a customs border, sitting on the road, eating chocolate biscuits (an aside: I’m trying out all the different types of chocolate biscuits in Chile and Argentina and “Chocolinas” are so far the best), right in front of a huge volcano. When we reached our Airbnb, a small window in the bedroom also highlighted a view of another volcano: Volcán Villarrica. This one, we climbed the following day.

Climbing Volcán Villarrica was such a fun experience! Like mountains in the Bariloche area, Villarrica turns into a ski resort in the peak winter months, but during the summertime, one can hike to the top with a guide. Unfortunately it’s no longer possible to hike all the way to the summit because the volcano is active and currently in the “yellow zone” so more active than normal. When it was last “green” (a little more than a year ago), hikers could even peer over the edge of the crater with a gas mask to see the red magma below. Towards the top, we got our feet back into crampons so that we could hike up the glacier. My favorite part was coming back down though: we donned thick jackets and pants and a protective cover for our butts (that our guide called a “diaper”) and got to slide down the glacial areas of the volcano! I did get stuck a few times (I forgot to keep my feet together and ended up acting a bit like a snow plow) but after we got a hang of it, you can really get some speed coming down the glacier (our ice picks turned into our braking mechanism).

This was my second time in crampons (after doing “Big Ice” in El Calafate). This was a steeper ascent and I still loved the experience!

There are many national parks in the Pucón area and we had to pick and choose which ones we visited. We first paid a visit to Parque Nacional Conguillío primarily to do the Sendero (Hike) Sierra Nevada. We really enjoyed this hike, especially enjoying the unusually warm summer-like weather and got to see the unique Araucaria trees. Parts of this park reminded us of Kona in Hawaii with its vast areas of lava rocks for endless miles. We got very lucky at the entrance of Conguillío national park — we didn’t realize that they only accepted electronic tickets and there was no cell service at the entrance of the national park. Instead of turning us back, the park ranger kindly let us through anyway! We learned our lesson from this experience and have been diligent about buying our electronic park passes since.

The drive back reminded me of the lava fields in Kona.

We also paid a visit to Parque Nacional Huerquehue (we still don’t know how to pronounce the name of this national park). We drove 2 hours to get to this park and alas, found out that I had left my hiking boots at our Airbnb!! I was really bummed out because we were looking forward to doing Sendero San Sebastián which would involve a bit of technical hiking (i.e. rock scrambling) towards the top, but it wouldn’t be possible to do without boots. Instead we did the Los Lagos hike which honestly exceeded all my expectations and really it ended up being a wonderful full day. We took our time with the hike since I was in sandals, but at one of the lakes, we found a spot that had a bit of depth and was nice and clear and we both plunged into the icy water. This day had all sorts of surprises for us: at one lake, Kevin got a bumblebee friend who would not leave his shirt no matter how much the shirt was shaken (eventually it was persuaded to crawl to a log instead) and I almost lost my hiking poles. I put them down at a lake to take pictures, but then forgot them. When we returned to the lake (to be fair, it was a couple hours later on the way back after finishing the circuit), they were gone. But! We ran into a French duo who had picked them up and were carrying them back to the park entrance! It was like my rain cover situation from the O trek all over again. They were so so kind and I was very appreciative to have run into them when we did because the remainder of the hike was a muddy downhill and the poles really saved me from a few slips in my sandals.

On our fifth day, we checked out of Pucón early in the morning and started a long drive south towards Puerto Varas. Puerto Varas is really interesting as we started to see a lot more German influence, including at a stop at Parque Nacional Vincente Pérez Rosales. Signs at the park were written in three languages: Spanish, English, and German. Puerto Varas also had more German restaurants which we really haven’t seen much of in either Argentina or Chile to date. We did a hike at the park called Mirador Cerro La Picada where we saw an old friend — Cerro Tronodor! This time we saw it from its other side, but it was a really cool experience to run into the same mountain again. We also had a Volcán Osorno on the other side of us so being sandwiched between two peaks was a unique 360 experience.

Cerro Tronodor! This time from the Chilean side!

Now becoming a bit of a habit, we both took a quick dip the nearby lake to cool off before heading over to our Airbnb which was about halfway between Puerto Varas and Ensenada. Finding our Airbnb was a bit of a challenge — it had started to rain and in the pitch dark, it was really challenging to find the turn off to our Airbnb. We circled around for about a half hour, trying to get a hold of our host with very poor cell reception but finally managed to navigate the gravel roads and two locked gates to get to our Airbnb.

We plunged into this lake on the way back from our hike. It was very cold!

On our second to last day in Northern Chilean Patagonia, we paid a second visit to Parque Nacional Vincente Pérez Rosales even though there are other national parks in the area. We drove up Volcán Osorno to do a crater hike there while listening to Beyoncé’s new album (we’re keeping up with culture!). Like Villarrica, Osorno also turns into a ski resort in the wintertime so it was cool to see the chairlifts on the mountain. We got re-routed while on the hike as there was a film crew on parts of the mountain filming apparently a new reality TV show where participants climb peaks in a race. We roamed around the park afterwards to see a few other small things like Laguna Verde and happened to see lots of folks picking deep red berries that were growing off the side of the street. Some hitchhikers that we had picked up told us that the red berries were called the Patagonian “Red Gems” and were delicious to eat. I couldn’t resist trying so we tried some and they were absolutely right — these were the most delicious berries I had tried in Patagonia since the Calafate berries. They tasted a bit like guava, a bit tart and a bit sweet. I ate several handfuls and Kevin kept having to backtrack to find me while I foraged for berries on every trail. These berries are actually called “ugniberry” and in addition to being eaten raw, are often turned into jams and liquor.

Our last day was a long travel day back to the Pucón area, to the Temuco airport to head to Santiago. Close to our destination, we took a detour to top at a hot sprints (“termas”), specifically Termas Geometricas which was an expansive 17 pool hot springs area with pools up to 44 degrees Celsius and two natural waterfalls at 9 degrees Celsius. While there were a lot of people at the Termas, I was surprised by how natural it was; the pools were built alongside the natural springs and there was one pathway that led through the vegetation so that you could pick your favorite to dip into. We ended our spa day by going from the 44 degree pool right to the 9 degree waterfall; I may have let out an ungodly yelp and disturbed the peace.

We don’t have any pictures of the “termas” because we left our phones in the car while we dipped, but we did see some really cute piglets on the road that we did capture on film.

</figcaption>

And with that, we headed out of Patagonia to Santiago! We’ve got quite a whirlwind planned for the remainder of April that we’re quite excited for and we’ll be ending our South American leg of our trip at the beginning of May. It’s crazy to think that it’s been 2 months already!

**Our favorites**:

1. We had many long drives on this trip and one podcast we’ve been listening to is called [The Fall of Civilizations](https://open.spotify.com/show/44DE64rRpX1cFIQUlqQtvi?si=WofwE6kmQauQ2WrURf4OYg). We first listened to the Easter Island episode in preparation for our trip but also listened to the episodes on the Songhai Empire and Khmer Empire. They were all very good, well researched, and balanced about aspects of the story where the narrative was not sure. Would recommend!
    
2. [Sendero Sierra Nevada](https://www.alltrails.com/es/ruta/chile/araucania/sendero-sierra-nevada) at Conguillío National Park.
    
3. [Volcán Villarrica hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/chile/araucania/volcan-villarrica).
    
4. [Los Lagos hike](https://www.alltrails.com/es/ruta/chile/araucania/sendero-los-lagos-de-huerquehue) in Huerquehue National Park.
