  <p>Before we knew that the Great Migration had sort of already happened this year, our thought was to try to get in two attempts to see the migration: one on the Tanzania side and one on the Kenya side since the Mara River constitutes as the border between the two countries. After our Tanzania safari, we sort of knew that we wouldn’t see any major crossing on the Kenya side either but we were still looking forward to checking out the Maasai Mara National Park and the Amboseli National Park, the latter of which is known for its huge African elephant populations and also the place where the Amboseli Elephant Research Project takes place, studying the elephants’ ethology. Well, we definitely found all the wildebeests in the Maasai Mara! From our Tanzania safari, Emanuelle, our guide, had mentioned that the herds of wildebeest during the migration are so large that they look like ants. That is a very accurate description. It’s really hard to judge exactly how many wildebeests there were in any given herd but it must have been tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. They seemed to extend from the vicinity of our vehicle all the way out as far as the eye could see. And they came with a commensurate level of stench as well. Pee-yoo! It was really stunning to see so many of these animals and we kept seeing herd after herd during pretty much all of our two and a half days in the Maasai Mara.</p>

<figcaption>

This is a photo of the Great Rift Valley that we passed by on our way to the Maasai Mara. The Great Rift Valley is considered to be a single long depression that spans from Africa to Lebanon but in reality, it's a series of different rifts and faults all in sort of a north-south line. 

</figcaption>

<p>For our Kenyan safari, we decided to try out a shared safari instead of doing a private one. It definitely made for an interesting experience! There was a bit of a snafu at the start of our trip with two of the folks who, <em>I think</em>, got accidentally added to someone’s private safari and last minute shuffled into our car. Then two folks who were supposed to be in our car missed their flight (from Singapore! I felt so sorry for them!) and ended up missing the first day and joining our car the following day. The result of this was that the car ended up being a bit tighter than it should have been (eight people instead of the maximum of seven that guarantees everyone a window seat) and I think folks weren’t having quite as much fun because of this. Not to say that people were grumpy! But each set of two tended to talk between themselves and because our guide had a sort of quiet voice, the folks that sat in the middle to back of the vehicle oftentimes couldn’t hear what he was saying about the animals. There were also age gaps and language barriers that didn’t help; there was one duo that came from China who spoke decent English but preferred to speak in Chinese. Another duo (the ones who got shuffled into our car last minute) were in their 80s. And the last duo were two friends from Malaysia who also preferred to keep to themselves and speak in Tamil, although I could understand every word they spoke. Oops, maybe I should have told them and gotten a little practice in myself. On day five, the couple who had gotten shuffled into our car got moved to another vehicle which eased up the spacing for the last three days which was very welcome. I switched to the back row of seats which I got all to myself and was fantastic because when the roof of the car was open, I could a) sit on the roof of the car to get some unobstructed pictures and b) easily switch from one side of the car to the other to see the animals. On long transition drives, I’d also stretch out horizontally and snooze a bit. Or read! I can’t read in vehicles while upright because it makes me feel nauseated (Kevin is very lucky not to have this issue) but when I’m horizontal, I have no motion-sickness while reading whatsoever. This was something I learned when I was child, going on long car rides to and from Michigan and I’d always take the back seats of the minivan.</p>

<p>I sat between the Chicago couple in their 80s for a couple days of the trip and had a good time chatting away with the woman (I forgot her name!) who had a bucket list of travel destinations that she was looking to get through before her health declined. She said she had a bit of a health scare with an severe case of pneumonia so now that she was back in good health, she was getting through all her destinations. After Kenya, she had plans to travel to Uyuni, Rapa Nui, and Antarctica all within 2024! We had some fun showing each other our travel pictures and exchanging travel stories. She and her husband both recently hiked the Inca trail which was so inspiring to hear and definitely has solidified it in our list of future vacations.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things about wildebeest is that that travel across the plains in sort of a single file. While we didn’t watch any migrations, we did watch some wildebeest cross a small creek which gave an impression as to what a real migration might look like. Once one of the animals takes the lead, there’s no stopping the herd until each and every one of them have completed the movement, whether that be simply to a new grassy area or across a stream. It’s really incredible to see the line of wildebeest extend out for what seems like miles until it seems to disappear into the horizon.</p>

<p>Some other fun sighting on the Maasai Mara leg of this safari included a tiny baby hippo that emerged out of some swampy water behind its mama. For a second, I was really nervous because there was a crocodile just a few meters away from where mama and baby emerged and crocs do eat baby hippos but mama saw the croc and a few grunts from her had the croc scurrying away. The croc is no match for a fully grown hippo! I also found it incredible how such a tiny thing eventually becomes a three thousand pound behemoth. Also baby hippos seem much more well-proportioned than adult hippos; I can’t figure out how those four stubby legs manage to move that much mass and at speed if needed!</p>

<p>On the third day of the safari, we did something a bit different than our usual hours in a Landcruiser: we went on a boat! There’s a cute island called Crescent Island in a lake called Lake Naivasha between the Maasai Mara National Park and Amboseli. It’s an interesting lake; the water levels have been increasing over time and we saw some abandoned buildings that were inside the lake where the boating offices used to be before the lake expanded. Out near the island (we didn’t disembark), we saw some very synchronized pelicans (check out the video!), more hippos, and tons of birds including cormorants, yellow-billed storks, Africa fish eagles, and kingfishers.</p>

<p>Synchronized pelicans!</p>

<p>On the shore of Lake Naivasha was the most curious thing: an overgrown area with the entirety of an old Air Kenya airplane fuselage. The wings and empennage were also scattered about the area though broken off from the fuselage. We stared at it curiously on the way to the dock to get on the boat but as we passed by it again, I couldn’t help but ask the guys operating the boat tour about the plane and why it was there. Guess what, it was being turned into a club! How Burning Man! I asked if we could check out the plane and one of the guys who was actively renovating the plane came and opened up the fuselage for us to climb into an explore. I went straight for the cockpit and the captain’s seat. The insides were still very dilapidated but I still found it so cool to wander around in the fuselage and check out the remains of the cockpit. They planned to open up the club in about one year; they definitely have their work cut out for them but I admire their creativity!</p>

<p>Lake Nakuru National Park was the focus for day four of our safari. It’s a fairly small national park but packs a punch with more giraffes, lions, rhinos (!!!), and uniquely, flamingos. The rhino sighting was incredible and even better than our Tanzania sightings; we saw a set of four of them slowly trundle in a single file across a thick grassy area. I can’t quite remember, but I believe these are the less rare white rhinos because they were traveling together socially (black rhinos are more solitary) and are larger (though harder to tell from the photos). I think the ones we saw in Tanzania were actually the black rhino which are much rarer (but not 100% sure). We also saw a rare species of giraffes called the Rothschild giraffes which were easily distinguished by their “white sock.” Their lower legs from knee-down are completely white with no markings and their patches are more fitted like a puzzle rather than haphazardly splotched across like the Maasai giraffes’.</p>

<p>Breakfast time for mama zebra and baby zebra. PC: Kevin.</p>

<p>Our final two days were spent in the Amboseli National Park. This park’s highlight is elephants. Scores and scores of elephants. I cannot get enough of watching the matriarchal elephant herds and we both loved watching baby elephants try so hard to copy the older elephants using the trunks and completely fail. We learned that it takes around six months or longer for baby elephants to be able to use their trunk for eating and drinking and in the meantime, they toss and twist their trunks in the most comical ways. I watched one particular young one try over and over to grasp a piece of grass in a small pond and look like he almost had it before it would fly loose. It really felt like watching a kid learn to use a fork or chopsticks to eat. Eventually he would get frustrated and trot over to mama and grab a swig of milk. It’s harder than it looks! A cool fun fact about African elephants is that each elephant usually develops a preference of whether to twist their trunk to the right or left which makes them either “right-handed” or “left-handed”!</p>

<p>One other funny symbiotic relationship we got to watch was between the cattle egrets and the elephants. These small white birds would constantly be flocking near the elephants’ feet because when the elephants paw at the ground to help loosen the grass they want to eat, the birds feed on the insects that are also surfaced. We had a great time watching these birds deftly hop around the powerful feet, avoiding getting squished and enjoying a meal. When the elephants would travel to another location, the birds would either hop along behind or seat themselves on the elephants’ backs and get a free ride. </p>

<p>A personal mini accomplishment: I finally got a picture of a lilac-brested roller. In Botswana, two years ago, I kept seeing these gorgeous birds but was constantly frustrated by either them skittishly flying away before I could grab a picture or, when I eventually got a picture, having a photo so grainy because I only had my smartphone whose camera zooming capabilities left much to be desired. On the very game drive in Amboseli, I saw one. And I had an excellent camera with the zoom lens attached. And I got it! The bird is absolutely beautiful. Kenya was a cornucopia of beautiful colorful birds and definitely a birdwatcher’s paradise. They are really difficult to photograph though so I have extra appreciation for anyone who manages to capture a snap!</p>

<p>We headed back to Nairobi after our last morning game drive in Amboseli and had long luxurious showers to de-dust (I was very thankful for the free lime green buffs we had gotten in Zanzibar while ATV-ing because it definitely helped me avoid inhaling too much of the dust and be able to cover my hair a bit to avoid having it become all cakey). Afterwards we went to a Papa Johns. After many days of eating chapati, lentils, and rice for lunch and dinner (which was very delicious, don’t get me wrong, just a bit repetitive), having an all-American pizza with two chunky pepperoncini peppers on the side really did feel like something special! I guess much like the Krispe Kreme donuts we got in South Africa and Ecuador, sometimes these small things that used to be “commodities” for us, suddenly become special when they show up in the most unexpected of places!</p>

<p>Phew, I’m almost caught up with all the Africa posts! I’ve given myself a deadline of trying to finish them before we leave Kazakhstan and I just have one more remaining which was our last safari in Rwanda and Uganda!</p>

<p>It’s always snack time for the elephants. I find watching them eat to be endlessly entertaining. PC: Kevin.</p>
