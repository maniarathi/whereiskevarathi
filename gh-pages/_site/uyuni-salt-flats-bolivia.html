  <p>One of my favorite parts about writing about all of our travels is going back and remembering all the things that I usually can’t remember at all nor can I jog my memory with pictures. Usually with travel (i.e. prior to this year), when looking back on the experience, I forget many of the challenging parts of the experience. Maybe if there was an exceptional or memorable difficulty, I might remember it, but even then, usually with a laugh. Rose coloured glasses. With writing about the experience a week or two afterwards, I still remember many of the random thoughts that crossed my mind and more of how I felt in a moment and can still try to capture it. Before we left, in the process of getting rid of most of our stuff, I also did a bit of a digital cleanse. I stumbled on a daily diary of sorts that I had written for a trip I had taken to Belgium for 2 weeks during my time at Google. Before reading the doc, I only really had positive memories of my time there. But when I read my own words (which I don’t even remember writing!) I realized that my experience had been way more dynamic. More highs and lows than I remember. There were memories in there that I could not remember at all. That’s been a big motivator for me to keep this up. I look forward to reading and reliving my experiences one day.</p>

<figcaption>

Off to Bolivia we go! I found it cool how many volcanos make up the natural barrier not only between Chile and Bolivia, but also previously between Chile and Argentina. Oftentimes the volcanos are split in half in territory belonging to each country.

</figcaption>

<p>After realizing how close we were to the Bolivian border, we decided to do a short 4 day trip to visit the Uyuni salt flats (“Salar”), the world’s largest salt flat spanning over 10,000 square kilometers, situated at 12,000 feet above sea level (~3600 meters). During the rainy season, a thin layer of water sits on the salt flat turning the expanse into the world’s largest mirror. We got lucky with our timing — we happened to be in Atacama in April which is the tail end of the rainy season. It hadn’t rained in several days, but there were still areas of the Salar that had a thin layer of water allowing us to take some spectacular photos.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/uyuni-salt-flats-bolivia/20240413_113745_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

One of the first stops we made was at Laguna Verde. Very similar to the pastel colors at Piedra Rojas in the Atacama desert but it felt even more remote!

</figcaption>

<p>The trip started out a bit rough, but mostly due to logistics. I believe there are some tensions between the US and Bolivia which makes it a little tricky to sort out the visas to get into Bolivia. We had some difficulty communicating with the travel agency we were working with to make sure we had all our documents in order before we arrived (probably one of the first times that our limited Spanish knowledge actually felt problematic) which required going back and further to the agency about 5 times and caused us a bit of stress on whether we were actually going to be able to make it or not. Well, it turns out we <em>didn’t</em> quite have our ducks in order and at the Bolivian border, we got asked for bribes a few different times for different things we didn’t have (i.e. a printed itinerary, a pre-filled out form, etc.). We managed not to have to pay the bribes by feigning zero understanding of Spanish. We’re out of passport pictures now though (I’m SO glad we had extra on hand), so need to restock. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/uyuni-salt-flats-bolivia/P4130091_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

Next to Laguna Verde was Laguna Blanca. The Laguna reminded me of the glacial lakes we saw in Argentina except this time, the milkiness was due to mineral salts in the water.

</figcaption>

<p>I found the process of getting into Bolivia to be a little funny though. On the Chilean side, we got picked up from our hostels/hotels and driven to the Chilean border to exit the country and then driven a little further to be dropped off at the Bolivian border. Then at the Bolivian border, we got picked up by our Bolivian driver and guide, a wonderful man named Andreas, who took us around for 3 days before we got dropped back off at the same Bolivian border to be shepherded back into Chile. The Bolivian border, Hito Cajones, seems like entirely a spot to hand off tourists between Chile and Bolivia.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/uyuni-salt-flats-bolivia/P4130107_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

Geysers at _very_ high altitude; we were at 4900 meters or 16000 feet. These are called Sol de Mañana and looked more like bubbling mud. This was still on our first day and I remember being quite tired at this point, because of our full day and probably a bit from the altitude as well.

</figcaption>

<p>Once we finally got past the Chilean border control, the Bolivian border control, Bolivian customs, and national park entrance (which took the good part of the first day) we finally started our journey through Bolivia, in a 4x4, towards the Salar. We stopped by a few high alpine lagunas, a hot spring (which was very welcome after sitting in vehicles for 8 hours), and ended our day at Laguna Colorada. I thought that I had seen lots of flamingos in Atacama but Colorada was just on another level of flamingos.</p>

<p>So many flamingos at Colorada!</p>

<p>One of the best things about these types of longer excursions is the people that you meet. In our cramped 4x4, we met a couple from Germany and a couple from the UK who we absolutely loved sharing the experience with. I remember that towards the end of our trip, we all appreciated how much we got along. It felt like a make or break situation because there were many aspects of the trip that were a bit challenging: very early call times resulting in less sleep, very high altitude environments that caused some altitude sickness (though luckily we all managed well for the most part!), and very dusty air from high winds that gave me a dull headache for a couple hours. Sharing the experience with people who were absolutely wonderful to talk to, who are interesting and have a really positive attitude made this trip extra special!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<figcaption>

Here we all are, wrangling a “camel.” :)

</figcaption>

<p>Our driver and guide, Andreas, was also fantastic. Though he spoke limited English, he communicated well with us and had the best ideas for photos. I was in awe of how he navigated the Bolivian “roads.” I add the quotations because there really were not paved roads at all to get from the border to Uyuni. There are gravel paths where many cars have driven before but those can get really jittery due to ridges that have formed, so many cars take more of a “forge-your-own” method to try their best to minimize the shaking of the car. I learned that I have a special talent for being able to sleep through aggressively turbulent driving. Kevin was amazed how I could pass out while the car was in what he described as a “constant earthquake.”</p>

<figcaption>

These were our digs our first and third nights. The juxtaposition of the toilet paper rolls against the beautifully arranged towels cracked me up. And the Disney princess pillow covers! :)

</figcaption>

<p>On Day 3, we woke up at 4:30am to set off to see the Uyuni Salar sunrise. Andreas made sure we found a perfect spot that still had the layer of water and we were the first ones there. I’ve seen lots of pictures of the mirror effect but seeing it in person was just absolutely unreal. <em>Everything</em> reflected in the water. It was such a weird feeling, walking out onto the water on the salt. It felt so isolated (even with all the other 4x4 with tourists dotting the Salar) and it just awed me to know that this remarkable piece of land even existed. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>Andreas took this time lapse video and coordinated the motions. He really had the coolest ideas!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<figcaption>

When the water was still, it nearly perfectly reflects everything. It was so beautiful to see!

</figcaption>

<p>&gt;</p>

<figcaption>

I took this picture right at the halfway point at sunrise so that half the sun reflected into the Salar making it look like a full orb. It was absolutely stunning to see.

</figcaption>

<p>There are a few small islands that seem to appear out of nowhere in the vast Salar and we visited one where we could hike up to the center to get a stunning view of the Salar in all directions. It really does feel like the Salar extends infinitely.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

Up on the island of cacti.

<p>The dry areas of salt flats allow some cool perspective photos to be taken and we had a fun time taking pictures after our visit to the island.</p>

<p>We ended our trip by visiting an abandoned train yard (the story goes that Bolivia had been planning on building an extensive railway but it was constantly sabotaged by the indigenous people and eventually the whole project collapsed after the mining industry imploded) and afterwards, we sadly parted ways with our travel mates at the end of the third day in Uyuni. Day 4 would be another 4am day to make the lengthy trip back to San Pedro de Atacama.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/uyuni-salt-flats-bolivia/P4150128_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our short few days in Bolivia were really something special. Neither of us really knew what we were going to see (besides the salt flats) and it constantly surprised us with its otherworldly landscapes and more wildlife than we’ve seen to date. It’s rural and rustic, but my eyes saw such beauty as I’ve hardly seen before. We wished that we had more time to spend in Bolivia but perhaps it was for the best as by the time we landed in Mendoza, we were both slightly sick (I had no idea so many colors could come out of my nose) and quite sleep deprived. We hope to be back there one day!</p>

<p><strong>Fun facts!</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Uyuni Salar was used to film Star Wars: The Last Jedi from 2017.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quinoa grows readily in Bolivia. That was terrible news for me since I have an intolerance to quinoa and there was quite a bit of quinoa served during our trip. Oops.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The word “salary” comes from the word “salarium” with “sal” being the Latin word for salt. In Roman times, people were paid in salt because of how valuable it was for food preservation which is why “salary” has the root “sal” in it. “Salar” is then a salt-encrusted depression (i.e. a salt flat).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are tons of lithium deposits in the Uyuni Salar. Bolivia holds around ~7% of the world’s known lithium sources.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
