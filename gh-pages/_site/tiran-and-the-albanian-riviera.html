  <p>If you had asked me a month ago, I definitely could not have pointed out Albania on a map. There are whole sections of Eastern Europe, especially in the Balkans, where I have geography blind spots. If you had asked me how long I thought it would be necessary to explore this small country, I would have probably said something like one, maybe two weeks. And here I am, sitting in Tiranë (pronounced “Tirana”), the capital, writing about our nearly two weeks in Albania so far with another 11 days to go. By the time we’re done with our travels, I feel confident that I should be able to recognize most of the Balkan countries on Worldle.</p>

<p>Before we began our year of travel (<em>years</em> before), Kevin and I had a Google Doc going where we would chuck in our ideas for where to travel. Albania was not one of them. Actually, we didn’t really have any of the Balkan countries listed. The story of how we ended up in Albania is actually a pretty fun one. While we were in Bariloche, we had gone out to Cerro Catedral, one of the mountains that dual boots as a ski resort in the wintertime and a hiking haven in the summertime, to do a hike and after finishing our hiking for the day, we had sat ourselves on the curb waiting for a bus to take us back to the city. Well apparently we and another ten or so people also waiting had gotten the bus schedule wrong by an hour and so we decided to call an Uber to get back to the city center. We offered if anyone wanted to also come with us and a German guy, who also happened to be traveling for a few months, joined us. While chatting about our various hiking experiences, he told us about a trail called the “Peaks of the Balkans.” He told us that it was a really beautiful multiday trail that was very much off-the-beaten path a few years ago, but rapidly gaining in popularity. The trail began in Albania and spanned across Montenegro and Kosovo. We wrote down the note in our phones as it sounded pretty interesting.</p>

<p>After our time in Western Europe and seeing the quickly burgeoning crowds, we were both eager to escape the classic summer travel destinations and go some place quieter. After Mr. German Guy (I forgot his name!), we actually heard “Albania” from a few other European travelers who said that the Balkans were growing in popularity as places that Western Europeans would travel to as Americans descended on the Londons, Parises, and Romes during the summer holidays. Croatia used to be the go-to destination but apparently the Croatian lakes have gotten too crowded as well. Albania made it to Lonely Planet’s “Best in Travel” list in 2023 (and number one destination in 2011) and its tourism has been experiencing an explosion in recent years but largely only for European travelers. We had both sufficiently recovered from the O trek and had been on a streak of visiting bustling cities so we decided that we were ready to go for another trek in the mountains. And bonus, there was a direct flight from Paris to Tiranë for $50. And so, largely thanks to a random dude we met, off to Albania we went!</p>

<p>The “escape-for-Western-Europeans” part appears to be at least somewhat true. As we do in most new places, the first thing we did after arriving in Tirana was go on a walking tour. There was not a single other American on the whole tour (there was just one Canadian) and almost every person was from countries like the Netherlands, Germany, UK, etc.. The walking tour was a fantastic glimpse into the complex history and blended culture that is Albania. Over thousands of years, Albania has exchanged hands from empire to empire from the Romans to the Byzantines to the Ottomans, before it went through a tumultuous Communist period during which time their dictator accused <em>both China and the Soviet Union</em> for not being Communist enough leading to their eventual isolation from the world. The isolationist period was terrifying; one could not get into Albania and if the police caught someone trying to leave, they were dead. The cities and villages that we passed through during our visit to the capital, our road trip through the southern part of Albania, and up the coast along the Albanian Riviera were palimpsests of these periods which granted us the opportunity to visit ancient Roman ruins, Byzantine and Ottoman churches and mosques, and play “I Spy” with the nearly 175,000 bunkers that were paranoiacally constructed throughout the country in case of invasion during the Communist era. Even the food in Albania was a delightful blend of Greek, Italian, and Middle Eastern which meant that we indulged in everything from delicious pastas, fresh Greek salads, crispy-yet-soft falafels, sticky baklava soaked in a syrup made with exceptional Albanian honey, stuffed eggplants (not the big tasteless ones from the US, the thin elongated ones that I find to be less bitter, softer, and overall far superior) and peppers, and moussaka with everything drizzled over with a good glug of excellent Albanian olive oil. For me personally, it’s been a nearly shocking experience to be able to go to a restaurant and when I ask for what’s vegetarian, they point out which ones are <em>not</em> vegetarian because everything else is. Even religiously, Albania is a mishmash. The people of Albania have historically practiced versions of Islam and Christianity that are highly tolerant and adaptable. Under their Communist period, Albanians were forced to give up religion (religion was outlawed) and became a secular nation, so even today, while the majority of Albanians identify themselves Muslim, only around 7% pray multiple times a day according to Islamic practices. We visited a mosque in Tirana where I was able to walk in without needing to cover my legs or my hair which I’ve never been able to do before. There are churches that have been repurposed as mosques, mosques that have been repurposed as churches, and from a high vantage point looking out onto a town, you can see equal numbers of both.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

</figcaption>

<p>One of the rather amusing parts of our walking tour was our guide pointing out all the unfinished buildings. There are <em>tons</em> of work-in-progress construction projects in Albania, not only in the capital but also throughout the other towns we visited. One particularly memorable building was intriguingly shaped like cubes stacked offset from one another; the story goes that the owner of that project decided to ignore the building restrictions and began building one extra cube on top that was one more than he had been giving permission for. So now the project is at a standstill, scaffolding still erected, while the permitting situation gets sorted out. Our guide joked that whenever people ask when something will be completed, the answer is always “January.”</p>

<p>Speaking of bypassing permits, we learned that Albania has an issue with corruption. Albania has been vying to become a member of the European Union for several years and one of the areas that the EU told Albania that they need to correct is rampant corruption. Our walking tour guide seemed fairly hopeful and optimistic that one day it would be addressed but definitely also gave the impression that currently, corruption is still a major problem in the government. During our walking tour, our guide had to reroute us from the usual path because it had been closed down by protesters who were displeased with the mayor of Tirana. Our guide said that protests are a fairly regular occurrence but no change had come from it because their demands tend to not have enough focus. We met some other folks from Western Europe later during our trip who discussed that EU membership for Albania seems like it’s still a ways off because “money just vanishes.”</p>

<figcaption>

Albania is very proud of the fact that Mother Teresa is of Albanian descent and has statues and artworks of her everywhere. Tiranë’s airport is even named after her.

</figcaption>

<p>One really interesting part of our time in Tiranë was visiting the BUNK’ART 1 museum (there is a second smaller one in the main square area which we did not visit) which used to be a bunker built in case of nuclear attack during the Communist period and was now devoted to telling the history of Albania, especially during that time period. It was really educational and the windowless, five story deep subterranean bunker was very interesting to explore as well. Much like the superfluous bunkers, this too was actually never used and only drills were conducted. So much for all those decontamination rooms.</p>

<p>We also took a bus out to the edge of the city where there was a gondola that took people up to the top of a nearby mountain. The views from the gondola were gorgeous and there was a small park at the top, but we ended up not spending much time at the top after we both forgot our jackets and forgot that the temperature drops at higher altitude. We were too spoiled by our high 20s degree weather (~80 degrees Fahrenheit) in the city proper that we forgot how much a little elevation can dramatically change the weather. We knew we were in trouble when we saw clouds grazing the tops of the mountains but alas, that was only while we were on the gondola. </p>

<p>After a couple days in Tirana, we rented out a car for eight days to do a road trip through the southern part of Albania which is especially known for its stunning beaches. During the summer, Albanians and other visitors, flock to the crystal clear waters of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Our plan was to essentially do a loop that would take us through Berat and Gjirokastër (not on the coast, but both known for its castles and beautiful city architecture), then nearly to the southern border with Greece to Ksamil (close enough that you can take a boat to Corfu Island and road signs are written in both Albanian and Greek), and finally up the coast to Himarë before making our way back to Tiranë.</p>

<p><strong>Berat</strong></p>

<p>We spent two days exploring Berat, our first destination from Tiranë. Berat itself is a stunning little city with houses that have been nestled into the mountains with uniformly whitewashed walls and brown roofs. The main attraction, Berat Castle, sits imposingly on top of the main hill where one can see it from pretty much anywhere in town. We had a cute little Airbnb in Berat that had a lovely view of these characteristic houses and of the castle. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/tiran-and-the-albanian-riviera/20240524_201736_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Berat Castle was a bit different from other castles we’ve visited before in Europe. The castle is more of a fortressed area with various small buildings inside. Today, many of the buildings have been repurposed. We enjoyed visiting one of the buildings that had been a church now turned into a museum filled with iconography that had been rescued from various churches around Albania. Other buildings had been repurposed into “bar cafes” or small shops. Some continued to exist, though on a wide spectrum of conservation, as an original church or mosque. It was really fun to be able to openly explore the castle with its narrow alleyways and gorgeous views of the mountains and valleys from the turrets. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/tiran-and-the-albanian-riviera/P5230018_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our second day in Berat was spent exploring, well not exactly Berat, but the nearby Osumi river for a rafting excursion. We had a lot of fun (but not a lot of pictures!) meandering down the gentle rapids of the river which can get up to class 5 or 6 in the peak of winter. We were lucky that we got to go at all as the river was nearly at its lowest point so in another week or so, the company will pause exucurions until the river rises again. We’ve got rafting before in Costa Rica but this time, we definitely learned some new scooching “techniques” to squeeze our raft through canyon walls. At least we didn’t need to let the air out of the raft like another group! The canyon that the river runs through was really gorgeous and we had a great time standing under some waterfalls and going for a dip in the cold water (but not glacier level cold!). On the way back to Berat, we stopped at another waterfall with a cute swimming area where we leaped off of the rocks, this time for a real cold plunge. For better or for worse, since our cold plunges in Patagonia, Kevin has roped me into jumping into very cold pools of water which is a ritual that usually involves me wondering how I ended up in a bathing suit staring down an icy blue pool below, psyching myself out about fifty times, eventually getting bored of myself about five minutes into my antics and because I’m now cold from the cold air, screaming as I jump in, and then getting out as quickly as I can with flailing swimming motions. And then doing it a second time because I can’t do all of that panicking just for one jump. </p>

It looks peaceful and innocent but I tell you, that pool beyond the far rock was viciously cold. Or as Kevin calls it, “invigorating.”

</figcaption>

<p><strong>Gjirokastër</strong></p>

<p>The next day we drove from Berat to Gjirokastër which is a small town of a similar ilk. On the drive down, we happened upon an Archeological Park called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_\(Illyria\)">Apollonia</a> while looking for a place to pause for lunch. It turns out, Apollonia was an Ancient Greek city that became an important literary center during the Roman period. It was actually the place where the first Roman emperor, Augustus (also the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar), studied and according to the their brochure, Emperor Augustus waived all taxes for the city afterwards in thanks. We had no idea this place even existed, but it was quite a sprawling city where we ended up spending a couple of hours exploring the vast ruins, of which 90% are still yet to be excavated. There were quite a number of tour buses and school groups at the park when we arrived but they pretty much all left by the time we finished lunch so we had a lot of fun exploring the ruins almost entirely on our own at times.</p>

</figcaption>

<p>We arrived into Gjirokastër, a city that dates back to the Byzantine Empire, fairly late so didn’t have time to do much but we did manage a visit to an old home from the Ottoman Empire era where the original family had opened it up to tourists. While the house was definitely not in the best shape, I found the architecture to be interesting and the house cat to be adorable. Plus on the way to the house, I got pelted with mulberries. There are tons of mulberry trees in Albania and the trees are absolutely loaded with ripe fruit right now so when a strong breeze flows, the mulberries are blown right off and onto any unsuspecting passerby’s head. I thought it was bird poop at first. I tried to catch some with my mouth open to the amusement of an old Albanian lady who was walking past but alas, to no avail. A little further down the road, a young girl was picking black mulberries off of her tree and kindly gave me a huge handful that I demolished in two minutes. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

My mini haul of black mulberries after I had eaten some. They were amazing, much tastier than white mulberries that I picked up from a market, and I was very grateful for the gift.

</figcaption>

<p>We spent the following morning exploring the Gjirokastër Fortress which was really incredibly and well kept. In my life, I’ve visited a decent number of castles, a surprising number of which have actually never had much action during key conflicts, like BUNK’ART 1. Gjirokastër Fortress, on the other hand, was an ancient castle that had seen quite a number of events as the castle exchanged hands from “empire” to “empire” that controlled Albania: Byzantine to Ottoman to Communist. During the Communist period, its prisons were used extensively to house political prisoners by Enver Hoxha. Hoxha himself was born in Gjirokastër; it doesn’t seem like there is any love at all for the former dictator in his hometown (and supposedly the distaste was mutual) as we saw his face scratched out in various photographs that were displayed in the castle’s museums.</p>

<p><strong>Ksamil</strong></p>

<p>After visiting the castle as well as an old Ottoman-era bridge that we hiked to and were able to walk across, we made our way southwest to Ksamil. We stopped by a place called Syri i Kaltër (“Blue Eye”). We had been planning on doing another cold plunge there as we were told that <em>technically</em> it’s not allowed but the guards look the other way, but the popularity had grown far too much and there were some newly constructed barrier that prevented anyone from plopping into the icy blue water. I’m still not exactly sure what the source of the water it; it looked like it was burbling upwards so I assumed that it was a massive spring of some sort but perhaps it also had a source of water further upstream as well. It was a bit difficult to trace. I took one of my favourite pictures here though: there were bright blue beautiful demoiselles flitting about in the forest abut the lake and I was able to capture one in very close detail. I didn’t know exactly how crisply I was able to take the photo until later and it was amazing to see the lacey structure of its wings.</p>

<p>With our base in Ksamil, we visited another archeological park called Butrint. Butrint was the site of an Ancient Greek colony, followed by a Roman city that thrived in the Eastern Roman/Byzantine empire. It’s a beautiful location right on the edge of the water and as with Apollonia, the park is sprawling. They had a pretty cool museum with some artifacts that date back to the eighth through tenth centuries BC which indicated that there was human occupation here even before it became a Greek colony which was very cool.</p>

<p>Besides ancient ruins, Ksamil was a lovely base for us to enjoy some time on the beach. We loved watching the sunset over the Ionian Sea and splashing around a bit. I was battling a minor cold so I was also trying to take it easy at this point. There was a Shrine of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine, at Butrint where I requested that I do not get a cold (I had just the throat tickle at that point) but alas, that didn’t work. Darn.</p>

<p><strong>Himarë</strong></p>

<p>I’ll keep this section pretty brief as the pattern is probably very obvious; we spent our last few days with Himarë, slightly north of Ksamil, as our base as we explored the nearby castle ruins, swam in beaches, did a little bit of hiking, and ate ice cream almost every day. The one hilarious thing I have to mention though are the beaches of the Albanian Riviera. The beaches are, inch by inch, <em>covered</em> in sun beds and umbrellas. I’ve never seen anything like it before. There are very tiny sections of beach that are left untouched by these sun beds. Or you have to find more hidden away beaches, like one we hiked to called Aquarium Beach, that are unadulterated. These beaches look like they have been setup to accommodate hundreds, if not thousands, of people but while we were there, they were nearly empty. Our understanding is that during July and August, these beds will be full (which honestly, sounds like a nightmare) but in the meantime, it looked comical with the density of these beds. I guess they were just setting up as one of our beach days, we decided to grab a couple and no one came around to collect the fees (usually around $10 per bed).</p>

Aquarium Beach. We hiked over a ridge to get here which resulted in a few scrapes and use of AllTrails but we found a better path to get back to our car.

<p>Phew that was a long one! Thanks for reading if you made it all the way here. We had such an amazing time during this first half of our Albania trip and with such a rich history that I had no knowledge about, there was so much to learn as well.</p>

<p><strong>Favorites (excluding some of the places I talked about earlier)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[Tiranë] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/28D4DM4EwmfCJ5DVA?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Le Bon Tirana</a>: amazing cafeteria style spot for lunch. I recommend the moussaka.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Osumi] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/TCVRxUh5AFJM6iap7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Albanian Adventure Park</a>: this company was fantastic for rafting tours on the Osumi Canyon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Osumi] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mk4WcfqzRpUbnJXH8?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Waterfalls</a>: a random waterfall we went to after rafting that was amazing and icy cold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Gjirokastër] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mekqEWNiZAcb4em67?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">te Fuçite</a> (“The Barrels”): a cute vineyard that had delicious food and actually good wine made by the family. The vineyard has a bunch of chickens roaming around that did not stop clucking all through our lunch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Himarë] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/o8eEpCLtyAZmdLEm9?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Castle of Porto Palermo</a>: a triangular fortress with a lot of history and various use through Albania’s periods. The one guy who was the cashier/guide/security was really excited that we came from Toronto as his daughter had graduated from university there and eagerly showed us her graduation video. She was returning to Albania soon and he said he hadn’t seen her in four years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Himarë] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/x3XcgVkbPZsiBNdA8?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Llogara National Park</a>: this park is pretty sprawling. I would recommend figuring out what hike to do before getting here because the visitor’s center appears to never be open and the trailheads are all over the place. It’s a beautiful area though and worth the insane switchbacks drive straight up a mountain to get here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Ksamil] <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xjiuGM5S1X2Yo5jo9?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Ksamil Water Sports</a>: here’s what to do: rent paddleboards or kayaks in the morning (the water is smoother in the morning) and go out to one (or more) of the three islands off the coast of Ksamil. The beaches are free and you’ll have them almost entirely to yourself. It was one of our favorite beach experiences.</p>
