  <p>It’s hard to believe but the number of posts remaining on this blog is now down to three, including this one. Or four if I decide to split our time in Tasmania in two.

<p>We really did a whiplash-like change when we hopped from Mumbai to Bhutan to Hong Kong. City -&gt; rural -&gt; city. After a changeover in Kolkata, we landed in a tiny country (erm, “special administrative region of China”) where English is the main spoken language, I could get a haircut from a hair salon run by British expats, and where we spent an entire day at Disneyland. Perhaps surprisingly, we also ended up doing a good amount of hiking as well, where we proceeded to feel superhuman as we charged up hills at breakneck speed, passing by all the other hikers, because we were now at sea level. It was really fun to magically feel extra strong simply because we went down a few thousand meters in altitude. </p>

<p>Hong Kong definitely had a bit of strangeness to it because of its current tense relationship with China. In many ways, being in Hong Kong felt like we were back in London. Hong Kong used to be a British colony after the Chinese Qing dynasty handed it over as part of losing the First Opium War. It was “returned” to China in 1997 but under the specific governing system of “one country, two systems” whereby Hong Kong would have its own governing system except for foreign and defense related policies. China agreed that that system would remain in effect for a period of fifty years, which is coming to an end in 2047. Hong Kong is just past halfway to that deadline and we got the sense that China is definitely prepared for it with the amount of propaganda we saw throughout the country. For one, almost all the museums in Hong Kong are free because China essentially pays for them so in most museums, we see a large amount of praise and highlighting of specifically <em>mainland Chinese</em> art and history. One museum we went to, hilariously called the Hong Kong Museum of History, had been completely re-curated to be an extensive history on mainland China’s history, how great its innovations had been, highlighting its might in the Olympics (we saw a lot of pride in the country’s performance at international level sports events generally), and most interestingly, how Hong Kong’s protests and riots in 2019 were caused by evil Western influences that corrupted the minds of the young people of Hong Kong. That last exhibit was on a separate level from the others and it was the only exhibit that had no English translation, but Google Translate exists so we were able to read what the panels said. In most museums, China would be referred to as “the Motherland” and throughout the country we saw zero flags, neither the flag of Hong Kong nor the flag of China. It will be interesting to see what happens to Hong Kong in another decade or so and perhaps it’s a good thing that we visited Hong Kong now. My impression of the country was that it was sort of like boiling a frog. The propaganda is obviously there. I can see how China can slowly start imposing their culture, one piece at a time. Even while we were there, China <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/18/world/asia/hong-kong-democrats-sentenced.html">sentenced 45 pro-democracy politicians and activists to prison</a>. China now effectively runs the judicial branch of the Hong Kong government (a consequence of 2019), even though that was one that was supposed to be independent, at least until 2047. Visiting Macau was perhaps a sort of preview of what was to come. Macau was a spotlessly pristine “special administrative region of China” that felt significantly more Chinese than Hong Kong, with far fewer expats, many more people who originated from the mainland, and a very condensed area isolating the previous Portuguese influences.</p>

<p>Beyond the politics of Hong Kong and Macau, we really did have an amazing time in both regions. The museums are really well done and we both loved how interactive the museums were, without overpowering us with too much dense material to read. We visited a gorgeous Museum of Tea Ware where Kevin had to shepherd me through to avoid me buying every teapot and teacup in the gift shop. I drank a lot of green and oolong tea in Hong Kong. There was always at least one bottle in my bag that we drank in lieu of water. Did you know that tea drinking has been a thing for over two thousand years?! I thought I was obsessed with tea, but after reading excerpts of the poetry that Lu Tong wrote about tea, I have realized that there are even stronger attachments to the beverage. “The fourth bowl raises a slight perspiration, and all life’s inequities disperse through my pores.”</p>

<p>The Palace Museum was also a really beautiful museum with a stunning collection of artifacts, including intricately carved jade and lacquer, beautiful landscape scenes painted on scrolls, calligraphy, painted fans, and even someone’s personal collection of hundreds of snuff bottles that his wife donated to the museum. </p>

<p>Pretty much every meal in Hong Kong was fantastic. We had everything from Indian dosas, to dim sum, to Italian appetizers at the <a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/bars/asia/list/1-50">best bar in Asia</a> (we had drinks too, which were yummy, but not as good as the ones Albert makes at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kb8C9J4faS7i7hVu5">C Suite</a>), to a tasting menu at Mora where the entire menu had some element made from soy imported from Canada. Apparently Canada has the tastiest soy beans in the whole world which we can now attest to because I don’t particularly like soy milk but the pure soy milk they had us taste at the beginning of the meal was genuinely and shockingly amazing. Vegetarian food was plentiful and the vegan ramen we had at a tiny upstairs nook was some of the best ramen I’ve ever had. While we were waiting for our spot at Bar Leone, we hopped over to a tiny Mexican restaurant that was mostly serving out large quantities of beer, but we had some amazing elote and even the plain old chips and salsa took us back to our San Francisco days. Even the food at Hong Kong Disneyland was pretty good which I was not expecting!</p>

<p>And yes, we spent an entire day at Disneyland. We both had a great time being kids at a themepark and we rode almost every ride in the park over the course of the entire day. We rode our favorite “Runaway Mine Cars” rollercoaster twice. We saw Moana and Lion King mini-shows that were surprisingly good spectacles and the fireworks showering over the Disney castle to cap off our fun day! It was nice to do something quite different from almost every other thing we’ve done this year. A theme park day every now and again is good fun!</p>

<p>After our Disneyland day, we spent the following day in Macau, which is certainly a spectacle in its own right. It’s essentially just the Las Vegas of China with tons of casinos all with different city themes like Paris or London or Venice. The Eiffel Tower in front of the Paris casino is actually a half-scale of the real one in Paris. We didn’t end up spending much time at the casinos besides walking through a couple and eating at one of the restaurants but we did have a phenomenal time at the Giant Panda Pavilion. We watched those pandas rolling around and eating bamboo for <em>ages</em> (see the video below). The pavilion had some other cool animals like lemurs and macaws, but let’s be honest, we were there for the pandas.</p>

<p>Pandas!</p>

<p>After lavishing our meager time in Macau with the pandas, we rushed through the Portuguese area of Macau on the northern part of the island. We visited the Walls of St Paul’s church, where only the façade and some of the foundations are left. We visited a nearby fortress that also had some nice views of the city. It was sort of funny being in an area that had a lot of Portuguese language around, although I’m not sure I heard too much of the language being spoken. It sounded more like an abundance of Chinese due to the high volume of tourists in the area. We took a ferry between Hong Kong and Macau so we had to rush back to the ferry terminal after visiting the fortress to catch our ride back. We had to wear a <em>seatbelt</em> on the ferry which blew my mind. I got really hungry on the boat ride and the boat was swaying around a bit due to some waves, but nothing I couldn’t handle as I waddled over to the bar to try to get something to eat. I promptly got yelled at for not wearing my seatbelt and roaming around the boat and was shooed back into my seat. That’s a first!</p>

<p>Our last day in Hong Kong was spent heading over to Lantau Island. We had a flight out that evening to Singapore but the airport was also conveniently located on Lantau so we dropped off our stuff at a storage locker in another big mall that was just a few subway stops from the airport. We continued onwards to the Ngong Ping Big Buddha sat serenely on top of a hill, surrounded by monasteries, and is that a cow?! Yep, just a couple cows just wandering around, standing patiently as everyone took photos with them. It almost felt like we were back in Bhutan except the decorations of the monasteries were noticeably more “gold” and there were far fewer people who actually prayed at the temples. We did observe one ritual in progress in one of the rooms where some monks were chanting which was interesting to watch for some time. It was nice showing up to this monastery after visiting Bhutan as we had some knowledge about what we were seeing and acceptable behavior like making sure to always circle the room in a clockwise fashion. As with the Bhutanese monastery insides, we were also not allowed to take photos inside the Hong Kong temples.</p>

<p>Getting to the Big Buddha was quite fun as well. We took a huge gondola ride from the end of the subway line up and over the island’s mountains, past the airport where we watched planes taking off below us to get to the Big Buddha area. Watching the sun drop down below the horizon and see the bottoms of the clouds turn a fiery pink-red was a perfect way to end our time in Hong Kong as we got ferried back past the airport in the other direction. We grabbed our stuff and in not too long, we were inside another metal tube, shooting across the runway we had just watched from above, disappearing into the night sky towards Singapore.</p>
