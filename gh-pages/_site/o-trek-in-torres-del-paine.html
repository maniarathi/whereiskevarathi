  O trek in Torres del Paine

<article>
  <p>For 8 days from the end of February to the beginning of March, we hiked the “Circuito O” in Torres del Paine, a ~110 kilometer route that runs through the backside of Torres del Paine and finishes with the iconic view of the Torres. The O trek is something that we planned to do even before we started our trip — we booked all the refugios a couple days before we left for Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>It’s hard to describe in words how spectacular of an experience it was to hike the circuit. This post definitely warrants far more pictures than words so I’ll add more pictures this time!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/20240228_091720_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 1: Laguna Amarga to Serón</strong></p>

<p>We bussed from Puerto Natales to the entrance of Torres del Paine National Park and took another careening bus from the entrance to Laguna Amarga which is the start of the O trek. Above, we are right at the start of the trek and we got our first glimpse of the Torres. It’s a nice teaser of what we’ll see after 8 days!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P2280017_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P2280020_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We arrived in Serón after a few hours of hiking. This was my first time hiking with a full backpack carrying our clothes, toiletries, etc. for 8 days. Our shoulders’ hurt a bit by the end of this day, but it wasn’t too bad and we recovered well for the next day of hiking.</p>

<p>We also decided to not carry our own sleeping equipment or cooking equipment or food. The refugios at each of the stops are very well equipped and at Serón we slept in a fancy elevated test (similar to a car roof top tent) nestled in the trees. Each of the refugios had hot showers (except Los Perros) and hot food. We also got lunches for takeaway each morning which we ate during our hike.</p>

<p>Our splurge weight item: a bottle of habanero hot sauce which came in handy for some of the more bland dinners and also for scrambled eggs which we had for breakfast 8 mornings in a row.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P2290025_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 2: Serón to Dickson</strong></p>

<p>We saw an unbelievably gorgeous sunrise this morning. I shimmied my way out of our tent to go and brush my teeth, turned around and stopped dead in my tracks when I saw this sunrise. It was spectacular (and we had many more stunning sunrises afterwards), but what a great way to begin day 2 of the trek.</p>

<p>Day 2 was the longest in terms of mileage (18 kilometres) but wasn’t too long in time as there wasn’t too much elevation gain. We really enjoyed this day of hiking and had some great views of lakes, sweeping vistas, and battled a bit of wind.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P2290051_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P2290062_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dickson was our favorite refugio. It was located in a picturesque spot (though many of the refugios were because they were located intentionally near water sources). When we arrived, there were horses roaming around freely (the horses are used to carry trash out of the refugios) and I spent a bit of time soaking the sun on some logs while a couple horses munched away on grass right next to my feet. It was unreal and felt like a fairytale.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P2290083_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 3: Dickson to Los Perros</strong></p>

<p>The walk from Dickson to Perros was blissfully short and sweet and we arrived at the refugio just as the rain started coming down. The rest time was needed because we knew that day 4 was the hardest of the entire trek, involving a crossing over a mountain pass (John Garner pass) and up to 12 hours of hiking depending on weather… and the weather forecast was not looking good. We’d started poring over weather forecasts each night watching the weather for Day 4 and it was forecasting precip, cold temperatures, and high winds. Not the combo we’d been hoping for :P A few O trekkers decided to power through and skip Perros with the hope of avoiding that bad weather day (we ran into a couple folks later on who successfully accomplished that intense option!).</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/20240301_082537_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3010127_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Above is a picture of the Perros glacier which we came upon just a few hundred meters away from the refugio. We had some fun trying to coax a piece of the glacier that was floating the lake to shore… a new sport that I hereby deem “iceberg fishing.” We were successful (I saw we, but really Kevin deserves all the credit for throwing rocks at the iceberg to try to get the resulting ripples to nudge it towards shore. I mostly poked at it with my hiking pole once it was nearby, spearfishing-style).</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/20240301_133233_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One thing we learned quickly is that there is absolutely no need to carry tons of water on this trek. I had been trained to carry plenty of clean water and on Day 1, carried 2 liters in my camelbak. In reality, there are TONS of fresh water streams where you can just fill up and drink to your heart’s content. The boldest backpackers we saw just carried a cup with them which they filled and drank from every stream they passed. That was a bit too bold for us, so we just started carrying 1 liter or less of water each day and drank from the streams which has delicious icy cold water (even if they sometimes look like grey water!).</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3010148_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Perros was easily our least favorite refugio though the weather definitely did not help. This was the only refugio that did not have hot showers. But remember, here a “cold shower” really means you’re bathing in glacier water so the best way to think about this shower is just imagine a Nordic cold plunge. Most of the trekkers opted not to shower this night, including us.</p>

<p>Perros is the most remote of the refugios so it had the worst food and accommodations as well. We all mostly ate quickly and early and headed to bed to try to sleep as best we could in the pouring rain. Perros kicks everyone out of the camp at 7:30am in the morning to ensure everyone makes it to Grey, but we got up earlier than that given the weather forecast.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/PXL_20240301_210450999_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 4: Los Perros to Grey</strong></p>

<p>Day 4 was a big day. Although only 15km in length, we clocked in 1061 meters elevation gain and 1516 meters of elevation loss. This was by far the hardest day of the whole trek and our favorite. Ultimately it took us about 10 hours total (including generous breaks) to make it to Grey.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3020163_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3020168_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>John Garner pass was spectacular. For the majority of our time on the pass it was snowing which made the trail difficult to see (I definitely went the wrong way a few times). At one point though, the clouds suddenly broke and the sun managed to shine through allowing the gorgeous picture above. Those few moments of sun were definitely a welcome relief.</p>

<p>Right when we got to the top of the pass, I took my pack off to grab a second pair of gloves and whoosh, my rain cover flew right off. I said so long to that rain cover as it flew back the way we came and we trudged onwards. My fingers were still cold even after a second pair of gloves so note of advice: bring thick ski-like gloves for this trek if your fingers easily get cold!</p>

<p>The rain cover story doesn’t end though… a little ways after we had started our descent, a trio caught up to us and lo and behold, they had caught my rain cover!! I’m sitting here quick thankful and I needed to use it again today when we were powering through more rain to get to a bus terminal. I still can’t believe they caught it and kindly carried it so far down!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3020183_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of the wonderful things about the downhill is that you get a magnificent view of Grey glacier all the way down. You really get a sense of how massive it is and the mountain backdrop against the glacier is just unbelievable. This part of the trek also showcased 3 huge suspension bridges built over 3 gorges which were really fun to walk across.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3020195_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the end of this day, we had completed the “O” part of the trek and were now joining the more popular “W” trek. We did mourn a little bit as the crowds started picking up but honestly, overall the day was just spectacular. At the end of this day, I was nearly limping across the finish line. Everyone was bemoaning their knees which was hilarious alongside the fresh W trekkers who were just beginning their journeys. That downhill really was endless!</p>

<p><strong>Day 5: Grey to Paine Grande</strong></p>

<p>Day 5 was a nice chill day to recover from the previous. We only had 3-4 hours of trekking so in the morning, we decided to exercise another body part and went on a kayaking excursion around Grey Lake. This was my first time in a sea kayak and I enjoyed how ridiculous we looked with all the wet suits and spray skirts. I’m more used to kayaking in shorts and t-shirt if I’m honest :)</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/20240303_100807_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We saw some wildlife (which was actually fairly rare to see in Torres del Paine!) and beautiful landscapes and we took lots of pictures given that the weather was lovely and we were not pressed for time given the short hike.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3030286_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 6: Paine Grande to Francés</strong></p>

<p>This day surprised by its length and difficulty. Today, we did one “prong” of the W trek which is a there-and-back to a mirador, Mirador Británico. We were able to leave our larger backpacks at a refugio that was on the way (Italiano) so at least the majority of the day was with a lighter load.</p>

<p>At the top of the mirador, we got gorgeous views back down to the valley, of the Andes mountains (which are across from the Paine mountains), and Francés glacier.</p>

<p>Francés had by far the best food of the entire trek (at least for vegetarian me). They served stuffed tomatoes with a calafate berry pudding for dessert that I will always remember as the one meal that did not need any hot sauce.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3040364_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 7: Francés to Chileno</strong></p>

<p>By the end of Day 7, I was definitely feeling my legs. As we approached Chileno, my pace had slowed to a crawl. We had now determined a new classification of hiking speeds; from fastest to slowest: flying, zipping, moseying, trundling, crawling, limping. I was somewhere between a crawl and a limp.</p>

<p>The weather was absolutely fabulous though and the early hours of hiking boasted (again) stunning landscapes. I had to do a mid-hike full outfit change as the weather really warmed up and switched into shorts and a t-shirt. What a turnaround from wearing a ski jacket, two pairs of gloves, two pairs of pants, a beanie, and more from Day 4!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/20240305_083438_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We tried to take a “shortcut” to Chileno directly and unfortunately went down a horse path which means we got attacked by mosquitos. Darn, I thought I was done with the mosquitos after Dickson! Another word of advice: bring bug spray. It was super buggy around the Dickson area and again along the path to Chileno and none of the mini stores in TdP sold bug spray.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/PXL_20240305_174251507_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3050403_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 8: Chileno to Laguna Amarga</strong></p>

<p>We saved the best for last. This day we finally did the second and last “prong” of the “W” that leads to the base of the infamous Torres. The benefit of staying at Chileno is that you’ve done about 2 hours of the hike up to the base so only have another 2 hours to go… which means you can see them at sunrise! We were again, poring after the weather forecast with the hope that the lowest layer of clouds would be clear. It was looking pretty good luckily!</p>

<p>We started hiking at 4:30am with most of the other folks at the refugio and slowly made our way up to the base. I wish I had a picture of the trail that looked like a string of Christmas lights as the hikers walked in a single file up a ridge each with a headlamp.</p>

<p>We got to the lake base far too early… I suppose when you can’t take pictures along a hike due to the darkness, the pace is quite a bit faster even with only headlamps to show the way. We did pause a couple times to take in night sky which, you can imagine, was wonderful. We were all a bit worried because low clouds were obscuring the Torres but as we waited, the clouds lifted.</p>

<p>Sunrise was magnificent.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3060408_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/20240306_071347_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/o-trek-in-torres-del-paine/P3060439_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After sunrise, we walked back down to Chileno and packed up and slowly made our way to Laguna Amarga for our bus back to Puerto Natales.</p>

<p>Throughout this entire trek, beyond the wonderful landscapes and features of Torres del Paine, another top highlight was meeting some really cool folks on the trip. We are lucky to have crossed paths with so many wonderful people and having many of them with us for 8 days and 7 nights was an added unexpected bonus.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>The O trek has truly been the highlight of our trip so far and really an extraordinary experience! We can’t recommend it enough!</p>
