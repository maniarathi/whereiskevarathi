<article>
  <p>As we landed back in Istanbul after one week of hopscotching the Aegean coastal regions of Turkey, the flight attendant announced “Welcome to Istanbul, the meeting point of the world.” After seeing seven ancient cities, I think that phrase should be used to describe all of Turkey rather than just Istanbul. The prehistoric and ancient history of this region is absolutely incredible and I had no idea exactly how dense these cities would be, each with its own stories about its trading importance or special significance in the annals of human history. For each city we went to, there would be signs to at least one or two more that we had to skip and for one of the cities we went to, a city where the ruins are underwater, our guide told us that archeologists still haven’t excavated or analyzed much of the ruins simply because the list of cities to be researched is so large in Turkey and there just aren’t enough researchers. And this is <em>with</em> international archeologists coming to Turkey from Austria, UK, the US, and others.</p>

</figcaption>

<p>We also learned that Turkey is home to two of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World and we were lucky to be able to see one of them which happened to be close to one of the ancient cities we visited, the Temple of Artemis. Sort of see. Six of the seven are extremely destroyed except for the Great Pyramid of Giza (though even for that, the majority of the façade is gone). And there’s one that people aren’t sure if it actually exists or not because no archeological remains have been found (Hanging Gardens of Babylon). The fact that this list was created back in the 2nd to 1st century BC was astonishing to me; I had assumed that this was some sort of modern list but no, it was created by travelers who were able to freely explore all the lands of modern day Greece, Egypt, Turkey, and Iraq, united as a single land under Alexander the Great. The relatively calm Mediterranean Sea also enabled easy nautical passage both for leisure travel and for trade. A fun legend we heard describes potentially the first instance of “corporate espionage” where Emperor Justinian I commissioned two monks to visit China to surreptitiously learn how silk was made and smuggle back silkworm eggs to Constantinople so that the Byzantine Empire could also start producing silk. This silk was then exported via the many trading routes, bringing even more wealth to the region.</p>

</figcaption>

<p>This blog post will be structured a little differently. I’ll have a follow-up post later that describes some of the places we visited outside of ancient cities. But I felt like seeing each ancient city side by side would be a good way for me to see the commonalities and differences as I write; sometimes all the theaters and the stadiums and the “peristyle” houses can blend together. The cities I’ll talk about are: Ephesus, Hierapolis, Aphrodisias, Patara, Kekova, Arykanda, and Myra.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Ephesus and the Temple of Artemis</strong></p>

<p>Ephesus was the first ancient city we saw after departing Istanbul and flying to Izmir on the western coast of Turkey. From Izmir, we took a transfer to Selçuk, the base for visiting Ephesus. Ephesus was built in the 10th century BC by Greek colonists; the story goes that the founder of the city was told by the oracle of Delphi that “a fish and a boar will show you the way” but I’m not quite sure how that translated into the guy picking a spot. In any case, he picked the spot and declared Artemis to be the protector of the city (each ancient city has one primary god or goddess who acts as the primary protector of the city). </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6180101_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

The Library of Celsius.

</figcaption>

<p>We really started off our ancient city tour with a bang; the city was massive! It must have once such a grand city to visit, with nearly every inch of construction made out of marble, tall rising columns lining the streets, and gorgeous friezes that decorate the façades of the community buildings like the Library of Celsius and the Theater. The Library of Celsius was such a spectacle to behold; it was unbelievably grand and honestly, if a library of such ilk was constructed today, I would try to frequent it as much as possible. It supposed held around 12,000 scrolls; that’s quite the library even by today’s standards! The theater was massive as well; seating around 25,000 people, it is considered to be the largest in the ancient world. I found it interesting that the theatre seemed to be dual purpose in serving as both the platform for drama performances but also for more athletic showcases like gladiatorial fights. Other cities we visited had a separate stadium for the latter.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6180117_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

The Gate of Mazeus that was built in honor of Emperor Augustus. Two slaves, one named Mazeus, built this gate after they were granted freedom by Augustus.

</figcaption>

<p>One thing we noticed about visiting these ancient cities is that each city really valued highly important visitors and even if they were just passing through, a special structure like a gate or statue would be constructed to honor their presence. Ephesus used to be by a harbour making it a wealthy commercial center (today it’s no longer next to water) and so it definitely had its fair share of famous visitors from Mark Antony and Cleopatra, King Ptolemy of Egypt (he retired in Ephesus), and Alexander the Great (though later we’d find out that this guy was just <em>everywhere.</em> Boy, would he have racked up flight miles if he was around today). Along with its famous visitors, the city had a pretty large wealthy population and one of the cool things we got to see were fairly well preserved terrace houses that they lived in. These houses cascaded down a nearby hill and each were decorated with beautiful wall paintings of animals and intricate mosaic floors that depicted Greek legends.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6180085_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

You can still see some of the wall paintings and mosaics in these terrace houses of Ephesus.

</figcaption>

<p>In honor of the protector of the city Artemis, a big temple was constructed but as with lots of religious sites, it was razed or burned to the ground a couple of times. Each time, the citizens would build it back up larger than before. For the third and final construction, Alexander the Great offered to pay for the reconstruction but the city refused, saying something along the lines that one god should not build a temple for another god. But I’m not sure what the real reason was and in any case, the city was able to fund and rebuild it themselves. The Temple of Artemis is actually a little away from the city of Ephesus and there isn’t much left of it. It was still really cool to be able to visit the site and see one of the columns left standing. There isn’t much anymore because the construction material was reused to build other buildings after it was destroyed the third time. At the museum, we saw some model reconstructions of the temple which gave an impression as to how grand it must have been. We also saw a couple of the statues of Artemis that once were placed in the temple. Even if there isn’t much there, it’s hard to describe the incredible feeling that we got, standing in the center of a place that saw so much history and once was one of the most incredible sights to see in the whole world. We didn’t linger too long as it hit more than 40 degrees (100+ degrees Fahrenheit) and we could feel the sun cooking us like kebabs. But still, it was such a cool experience!</p>

<p>One fun fact: the main beer of Turkey is called Efes, named after the city of Ephesus.</p>

<p><strong>Hierapolis</strong></p>

<p>Hierapolis was a bonus ancient city for us. We traveled to Pamukkale to visit the famous cascading travertines filled with warm calcium carbonate saturated water that creates the white cotton-like deposits. The word “Pamukkale” literally means “cotton castle”; “pamuk” meaning “cotton” and “kale” meaning “castle.” In a separate blog post, I’ll talk about that experience which was also awesome! Adjacent to these travertines, was the ancient city of Hierapolis, built in the 2nd century BC with Apollo as its principle protector god. The city is the equivalent of modern day Florida; it was the place to retire so that folks could enjoy the last days of their life hanging out in the hot springs. Also, people would come out to the city on a health retreat as they believed the hot springs had healing properties. Out of all the cities we went to, the necropolis of Hierapolis that was abut to the city gates was the most extensive and impressively well preserved. We walked out to the necropolis but given how large the whole area was and again, the unrelenting heat of more than 40 degrees, we didn’t see the whole thing. There’s an impressive number of sarcophagi, around 1200, scattered throughout the area which was one of the indications that the city was a prime retirement location.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6200106_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

The necropolis, just outside of the city gates, extends quite far! The whole area is full of sarcophagi remains.

</figcaption>

<p>One fun thing we learned while visiting this city was the placement of baths. In Hierapolis, there are some impressive remains of the baths that were placed just outside of the city. The rule was that in order to be able to enter the city, travelers had to first bathe. It was their way of trying to minimize the spread of disease at the time. There were three types of pools: the caldarium (hot pool), the frigidarium (the cool pool), and the tepidarium (the warm pool). One would work their way through all the pools, much like a modern day spa, before entering the city. We both found it amusing though that once clean, the first thing the person would see and smell once through the northern gate, was the toilets. Later on, we were told that the baths were more than just simple bathing stations; it was also their sort of doctor’s office and CDC where you would be checked for any diseases and treated before being allowed into the city or turned away.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6200098_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

</figcaption>

<p>Another structure that was very cool was the theater. Not as large as Ephesus’, it was a very big one with gorgeous friezes and statues that created the backdrop for the stage. When we came back to visit the travertines for sunset, we paid a second visit to the theater in the dark which was lit up. I really felt like I was seating myself down for an evening Broadway show. I hope there is some way to use the theater again for modern day performances because the reconstruction is just stunning and what a gorgeous setting to be able to perform against. At a random ancient theater in Cappadocia, we saw a street performer take the stage crooning out ballads from Ed Sheeran hits to Turkish jams. It was a cool experience for us, but it must have been even cooler for her as a performer. What a venue!</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6200038_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Though a bit touristy, Hierapolis had a cute pool where we could bathe/swim with some ruins. That was pretty fun, even if it was a bit cheesy and potentially the ruins might have been placed there rather than naturally occurring in the pool area. But when in Hierapolis… you know? :)</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6200071_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Aphrodisias</strong></p>

<p>Named after Aphrodite, this 3rd century BC city was one we visited as a day trip from Pamukkale. Unlike the other two cities to date, this one was incredibly quiet as it was an hour drive from Pamukkale and not really near a major city or our tourist site. It was a fairly small site, especially compared to Ephesus and Hierapolis, and because it is located in an especially earthquake-prone zone, it’s been destroyed by several quakes and eventually the population petered out around the 7th century.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6210006_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

Many of these friezes have been rescued from various ruins in the city and brought together as a huge display wall at the entrance of Aphrodisias.

</figcaption>

<p>We loved exploring the remains of the stadium here. We hadn’t seen any stadiums in cities to date so it was especially cool to see one of the largest that could contain up to 30,000 people. Apparently people from nearby cities would come to Aphrodisias just to attend events like gladiatorial fights at the stadium. We had some fun trying to find the reserved seats that had markings for various important groups of people and then trying to decipher the Greek. Our combined knowledge of the Greek alphabet is decent but we both struggled to convert the letters into the appropriate sounds. And of course we don’t actually understand any Greek so had no idea what most words meant.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6210014_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

The huge stadium! Unlike other stadiums of the time, this one has seating throughout the entire perimeter.

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6210017_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

This was one of the marking we found that designate a section of seating in the stadium for a particular group of people.

</figcaption>

<p>One fun thing that was found in Aphrodisias was the Edict of Maximum Prices that Emperor Diocletian created in 301 AD in an effort to curb inflation at the time. We had a great time reading through the various prices including an extensive list of every possible thing that could be colored in purple (purple was a rare and expensive color), the price of all food stuffs like turnips, and realizing that lawyers made an absolute killing even 2000 years ago.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6210034_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Perhaps more than the other cities we’ve visited to date, this one definitely felt more “in ruins.” There were piles of broken columns, areas where the course of nature had started to grow in the cracks and cover up some of the marble, and columns that were a bit offset from each other looking like they may fall over with the slightest breeze. This was interspersed with a few well reconstructed buildings that belied the former beauty of the city. We really enjoyed visiting this site as it felt noticeably different from the other two. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6210022_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Patara</strong></p>

<p>Patara, the birthplace of Santa Claus! After visiting Aphrodisias, we headed to Ölüdeniz which is right on the Mediterranean coast known for its beaches and for paragliding. We picked up a rental car on our last day and did a mini road trip through the coast, driving eastwards towards Antalya (though we did not actually visit Antalya at all). Between Ölüdeniz and our next destination Kaş, we found a dual beach-plus-ancient-city site called Patara. Patara was one of the most important cities in the ancient region of Lycia from the 15th-14th century BC to roughly 500 BC. Lycia, we learned, was an incredibly important influence during the development of the US Constitution; both Alexander Hamilton and James Madison cited the Lycian form of government as a model for a proposed US government including the idea of having each state have a variable number of representative (now modeled in the House of Representatives) as well as the idea that states would largely be independent but brought together by a federal system for important shared interests (separate of federal and state). I had no idea that this is where some of the most important ideas of the US government principles came from! Patara had three votes in the Lycian League, which was the maximum that any one city could have, due to its seaport which facilitated much trade.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6240007_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is still much of Patara to be excavated, but we enjoyed strolling around the area, seeing the theater and the columns that lined the city’s main street. I think there were probably more goats enjoying the grass growing between the pieces of fallen marble than there were humans who were exploring the ruins here. Most folks headed straight to the beach which was one of the largest we had been to in Turkey. We did learn that Patara is where Saint Nicholas was born though he ended up spending most of his time in Myra and thus his full name is Saint Nicholas of Myra. There was a church near Myra where he was a Bishop but unfortunately we didn’t get a chance to visit that.</p>

<figcaption>

Clearly we have been visiting too many ancient cities. Here’s our ancient city of sand!

</figcaption>

<p><strong>Kekova</strong></p>

<p>Technically this “city” has no official name yet as it hasn’t been studied by archeologists but the nearby island is called Kekova Island so folks call these underwater ruins “Kekova ruins.” From Kaş, we did a kayaking excursion that took us along the edge of Kekova Island where we could see the ruins of the former city both underwater, hovering quite close to the surface of the water, as well as some of the ruins on the island that have not yet sunk. We had an amazing guide with us who told us about some of the history of the place and of Turkey more generally while we paddled. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6250056_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

A little difficult to see, but the foundations of either a house or store are just beneath the surface of the water.

</figcaption>

<p>Unlike the other major cities, there weren’t big theaters or stadiums or baths to really see. A lot of what we saw were the foundations of former homes or stores, some sarcophagi, and remnants of churches. One pretty cool sight was seeing a set of three crosses that had been painted on a building submerged in the water and above it, another three crosses that were still above water, repainted after the structure sunk. There was also a fortress, Simena Castle, on one of the islands though it was not part of Kekova; it was built in the 4th century BC and we got some beautiful views of the islands from the top. </p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/P6250092_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

Gorgeous views of Kekova from the top of the fortress!

</figcaption>

<p>It was such a unique experience to be able to see a sunken city even if our guide kept warning us to manage our expectations: “it’s not Atlantis” he kept saying. One fun tidbit he told us about was how land was divided up between the children of families. The land in the area is very fertile and back then and today, agriculture products have been one of the main exports of Turkey. Turkey’s top exports are hazelnuts, dried fruit, safflower oil, and fresh fruits and veg (especially tomatoes). As inheritance, sons would be given the fertile land away from the coast to continue the agriculture business and daughters would be given the rocky coastal regions sort of as a token and/or for dowry. Today, those coastal regions are absolutely booming with tourism and our guide chuckled that women had their revenge now all as millionaires while the men still toil away in the greenhouses inland.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/the-ancient-cities-of-turkey/20240626_175237_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<figcaption>

There are tons of greenhouses in this area. These greenhouses are currently empty during what they call “extreme summer” and usually people will flock to a sister city in the mountains to escape some of the heat. However during the winter time, these greenhouses produce fresh vegetables and fruits in plenty that are exported at a premium. PC: Kevin

</figcaption>

<p>Even though history-wise, this was a pretty lightweight day, we loved spending this entire day paddling around the Mediterranean. I got my first jellyfish sting (it was a tiny one so the swelling went down pretty quickly but.. oww!!), Kevin did some cliff jumping (I jumped off of a mini rock), and we had an amazing guide who loved telling us the gross stories of our human past.</p>

<p>One fun gross story: the people around Kekova were known for being able to product purple dye that was made from harvesting some sea creature in the Mediterranean. However, the production process was so stinky (it involved fermenting those dead sea creatures) that the men would reek and the story goes that women were granted the ability to divorce their husbands here to escape the stench.</p>

Another “gross story” that our guide told us: sarcophagus literally means “flesh eating” stone because the tombs supposedly hasten the decomposition process. Typically each family gets one tomb and between deaths, the tomb is cleaned out to make space for the next person.

<p><strong>Arykanda</strong></p>

<p>Visiting Arykanda was a recommendation from our kayaking guide. He mentioned that it was tucked high up in the mountains so suggested it might be nice to be in a place with some elevation to escape some of the heat. Alas, it was still boiling hot in this ancient city. </p>

<p>Before talking about Arykanda, I want to revisit the ancient region of Lycia of which Arykanda was also a part. While Kevin and I were driving between the various cities (both present day and ancient), we were listening to another episode of Fall of Civilizations, this time on the fall of the Bronze Age. It was a dramatic episode. One thing that was prominently featured was the role of a group called the Sea Peoples in the Bronze Age decline; this group went through city after city along the Eastern Mediterranean coast plundering and destroying cities in such a way that they never could build themselves up again. This group of people even went after Egypt, though were eventually defeated with heavy Egyptian losses. The Sea Peoples did not have any central authority and was thought to be a band of somewhat disjoint peoples based on Egyptian sources. Today we do not know exactly who was a part of this group, but one subgroup is confirmed which is the Lukka: the people of Lycia. As we learned this from the podcast, we parked our car right in front of an ancient Lukka’s house to eat lunch sitting on the wall ruins.</p>

<p>We thought Patara was quiet, but for the first half of our visit to Arykanda, there was absolutely no one else there. It’s a truly beautiful city; nestled in the mountains, the ancient structures have a beautiful view of the mountains and valley beyond. It was incredible to see how they managed to build a pretty large theater, stadium, agora, bath, and other community buildings on an inclined hill. In the heat, we were panting as we climbed up to visit each of the sites but there were quite a number of young pine trees providing some shade.</p>

I think these were some of the baths, but I can’t remember exactly.

A bit cut off but you can see a glimpse of the beautiful view of the mountains from this structure.

<p><strong>Myra</strong></p>

<p>Last, but not least, was the ancient city of Myra, another ancient Lycian city. Our visit to Myra was pretty short because the city today is largely built over by the modern city of Demre. Today, there are just a couple of structures to see, most famously the necropolis made up of rock-cut tombs in the cliffs of the city. These tombs were carved so that they looked like wooden doors and back in the day, were painted in vivid red, yellow, and blue. Myra also had a nice reconstructed theater with some pieces of the adorning friezes scattered throughout the site.</p>

<p>After all these ancient histories though, one of the most amusing commonalities of these ancient cities was how every single one of them were overrun by cats. And so, to end this blog post, I will share some “cats on Roman ruins” pictures that really showcase who are the real emperors and empresses of Turkey today.</p>
