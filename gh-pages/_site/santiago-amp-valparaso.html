  <p>I went into Santiago with low expectations if I’m honest. Perhaps part of it was leaving a place that we were starting to feel some attachment to (i.e. Patagonia). Another big part of it was from talking to other folks on the Torres del Paine O trek who told us to spend “one, maybe two days” in Santiago and shook their heads as they told us not to waste too much time there. “It’s not like Buenos Aires” they said. Ultimately, I don’t think their advice was wrong — Santiago is more rough around the edges than Buenos Aires and we’re pretty satisfied with our two full days in Santiago plus one day in Valparaíso (~1.5 hour drive away from Santiago towards the west coast of Chile). The three days we experienced were really enjoyable and we ended up learning a lot about the Chile’s history!</p>

</figcaption>

<p>In my Odds and Ends post, I mentioned that neither of us were really feeling any homesickness. However, I did feel one surprising thing in Santiago; even though it was my first time visiting Santiago, I felt a sense of ease in the city. Santiago is not the safest of cities (our Airbnb host recommended that we don’t walk out in the streets past 8pm and we’d be warned about pickpocketing), but I think the thing that made me at ease was that it was a <em>city</em>. I know how to navigate a city and many of the things that I <em>was</em> missing (like Indian food and good soap), I knew would be easily accessible in a metropolitan city. There’s a certain level of comfort that I think I felt, knowing that the things I <em>wanted</em> (rather than needed) were at my fingertips. It was an interesting feeling to feel and took me a bit by surprise.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>Like most cities we’ve visited, we first took a walking tour of Santiago. Walking tours in South America have been really of top tier quality; I’ve appreciated that all the tours we’ve taken have delved into the messy histories of the country/city and into recent politics where our guide typically is unafraid to express their own personal view point. On our Santiago tour, our guide retold the history of a particularly tense and tragic time between two Chilean leaders: Allende (from the Socialist party) and Pinochet (who overthrew Allende and began a period of military dictatorship in Chile marred by severe human rights violations). There is a Human Rights museum in Santiago that we wished that we had time to visit that provides a deeper dive into that historical period which really wasn’t that long ago: 1973-1990.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

La Moneda Palace, the Chilean equivalent of the White House. It was here that Allende was overthrown in a military coup. Today, there are statues of all the Chilean presidents lining the plaza except for Pinochet.

<p>While Santiago is a pretty sprawling city, there’s pretty much just a couple neighbourhoods (Lasterria and Bellavista) right next to each other that has all the main sights. The remainder of the city is residential or commercial. We did enjoy some delicious food at some fantastic restaurants in Santiago (thank you <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/26/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-santiago-chile.html">NYTimes</a> for the restaurant suggestions that did not miss) and drank more than one pisco sour. I learned that Chile also claims that the pisco sour is of their origin and is constantly in a battle with Peru about this claim. I will confirm that the pisco sours were excellent, though the best one was a spicy pisco sour I had on our last day in Santiago… at a Peruvian restaurant :) </p>

<p>Our first day in Santiago happened to be Easter Sunday and it was actually kind of cool to be visiting some of the beautiful churches while Easter service was in full swing. We thought that it wouldn’t be possible to visit the churches but they were very open. We couldn’t visit much on this day because it was Easter Sunday (and in generally, not much is open on Sundays) but we also enjoyed strolling up a hilly park to get a view of the city.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>We also visited a museum on Pre-Colombian art which was incredible. There is such a vast and complex history of the Indigenous peoples that were first on the continent of South America and I know so little about these people. One thing that blew me away is that the oldest mummies are actually not from Ancient Egypt; the oldest mummies actually are from South American where the indigenous people developed their own unique mummification process. Pre-Colombian history is something I would love to learn more about and I’ll have to find some books to read (after I get through my current reading list!).</p>

<figcaption>

The Incas used these knots or “quipus” to store information about their people. This one is speculated to hold census information and has 15,024 pieces of information.

</figcaption>

<p>A couple days later (on Mondays, all public museums are closed so we visited Valpairso on the Monday instead), we also visited the Fine Arts museum (Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes) and the Museums of Contemporary Art (Museo de Arte Contemporáneo). Both were lovely and showcased artists primarily from Chile, but they were both undergoing extensive restoration and only a couple rooms were open in each.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>We sandwiched one day in Valpairso between our two Santiago days which we actually weren’t sure if we could visit due to the recent wildfires near the area. The wildfires weren’t near the city itself so we were able to visit, but while gazing at the Valparaíso port from a viewpoint, we saw helicopters filling vats with water. My assumption is that it was for fighting the fires, but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Valpairso is a very hilly city (it’s called The San Francisco of South America) and absolutely packed with graffiti. It’s really vibrant and has a little bit of a hippy vibe that was very familiar to me after our time in San Francisco. It has many tiny funiculars where you can pay 100-300 pesos (10-30 cents) to go straight up the hills.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p>We did another walking tour, though one focused on the street art, that was absolutely fantastic. We had a young guide that took us to areas of art that we wouldn’t be able to go on our own (including one area where young up and coming graffiti artists practice their work) and taught us a lot about graffiti culture generally. We learned about terms like “tags” (the signature of the artist), “throw up” (a really quick piece of graffiti), and “TOYS” (which stands for “tag over your shit” and is a mark of shame for an artist who has marred others’ work by adding their tag to another piece). Valparaíso reminded us a bit of Bogotá which also had a very vibrant graffiti scene; I found it very cool that the public would commission graffiti artists to come and paint their storefronts; plus it acted as an insurance policy from having their storefront instead covered in not as attractive “tags.”</p>

This one was painted by a couple who are both graffiti artists who met as young children. The wife was 6 months pregnant when they worked on this art together. This is the tallest graffiti in Valparaíso.

</figcaption>

<p>We ended our short Santiago visit by paying a visit to San Cristobal; we walked up the hill (we missed all of our usual uphill hiking!) and took the gondolas to see some stunning views of the city against the backdrop of the Andes mountains.</p>

<p>&gt;</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/santiago-amp-valparaso/P4020025_Original.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Overall during my time in Santiago, I caught myself saying “oof, it looks like X has seen better days.” I was happy to see that there were plenty of restoration projects underway and I came away with the feeling that Santiago is a city that has a lot of potential. I’ll be really excited to see how the city transforms as it completes some of the projects and hopefully continues to grow in popularity as a destination. And with that short stay, we departed from Santiago to Easter Island (a.k.a. Rapa Nui). As I write this, I’m actually just about to land back to Santiago from Rapa Nui (T-minus 20 minutes!) and I know I have far too much to say about our time in Rapa Nui. It was so wonderful in so many ways and perhaps it’s good that this one is blissfully a bit shorter to make room for the next one! See you then!</p>

<p><strong>Our favorite restaurants</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/b8MzwkEHXXuyds687?g_st=ic">Sarita Colonia</a>: a Peruvian-ish, Asian-ish fusion restaurant where I strongly recommend ordering the spicy pisco sour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SDcN7v9MoAKpr2BQ6?g_st=ic">Bocanáriz</a>: a wine bar that served excellent wine flights (we would recommend the “Iconic” wine flight) and bonus, excellent food as well!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pgapAh7VoB1QhPLZ9?g_st=ic">Liguria</a> in Lasterria: we would recommend trying the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_choclo">pastel de choclo</a> here. While it’s not really my thing (it’s basically a shepherd’s pie but with a corn-based top instead of potatoes), this cafe offered a vegetarian version of the Chilean dish. They also serve Chilean pisco sours that were delicious!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kCbCkCpn2ZpDQLCQA?g_st=ic">Castillo Forestal</a>: a French cafe that served simple food on fresh crispy-yet-soft-on-the-inside baguettes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the streets, especially near the museum areas, there are mobile stalls that serve tangerine juice. Get one. It’s delicious and an excellent midday refresher in the Santiago heat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PLvzjzGJ9QMBSfur7?g_st=ic">El Peral</a> in Valparaíso: their battered and fried cauliflower sandwich was the bomb.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Our favorite “things-to-do”</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.valpostreetart.com/">Valpo Street Art tours</a> (thank you Sidney for the recommendation!)</p>

  <li>
    <p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/SY6Jq1zM9YFLSesw6?g_st=ic">Chilean Museum of Pre-Colombian Art</a>: this was an extensive museum and full of history and artifacts that I had no clue about. We both learned a lot from this museum and almost everything had an English translation.</p>
