  <p>For a minute, I thought I landed in India when we arrived in Zanzibar. The amount of Hindi I heard, the streets densely packed with people who share my skin color, the tiny hole-in-the-wall eateries enticing passerbys with ambrosial <em>biryani</em> and <em>dosa</em>, clamorous markets selling green, yellow, and red bananas, and the rusted blue sugarcane presses pulverizing the grass into sweet, earthy juice all felt strangely familiar. But nope, we were in Tanzania. Zanzibar is an island off the east coast of Tanzania mainland. It’s a beach paradise with a few other satellite islands nearby and is known for really good snorkeling, lovely beaches, and the abundance of spices that grow inland, especially cloves. Zanzibar also has a sad history; because of its ideal location for sea-based trade, Zanzibar used to be a hub for trading slaves. The British, Portuguese, and Americans all used Zanzibar as the locations where slaves would pass through from all parts of Africa before being transported overseas. Much of the evidence from this past no longer exists on the island, save for a few plaques and evidence of colonialism from opulent doors that were constructed during the British reign. We ended up spending just four days in Zanzibar before flying to mainland Tanzania because we were a little “beached out” after Mozambique. It’s a fairly small island so we felt like four days ended up being a good amount of time to see all the things we wanted to see; it would be a lovely destination to have a relaxing vacation if one had more days!</p>

<p>We spent our first couple of days wandering around Stone Town which is the main city of Zanzibar. The center of the city is a maze of tall stone no-car alleyways where it is extremely easy to get lost. We used Google Maps to get around (bless technology) but even so, we’d end up frequently taking a wrong fork and end up in a completely different area than we expected. It was fun to just stroll around and absorb the din that also reminded me of Istanbul at times with lots of people yelling out to us “Brother!” or “Sister!” to try to get us to look at their wares for sale. Stone Town is definitely very much a tourist town and felt a little like Spain to me where the streets were filled with very obvious tourists, dragging rolling suitcases through the uneven streets. The food of Stone Town was phenomenal. One of our first meals was at one of the many Indian restaurants where we enjoyed <em>dosas</em>, vegetable <em>kolhapuri</em>, and roti. We also had some fantastic Swahilian food at a place called Lukmaan that truly was an institution. The original location was closed for expansion so they had opened up an annex which Google Maps placed in totally the wrong place. We ended up asking around to try to find it but it’s famous enough even with the locals that everyone knew where it was. Also as we got closer, we could smell the aromas wafting through the streets. Ordering at Lukmaan was a hilarious experience; we were given menus and attempted to order a combination of rices and curries but we’d name a selection and our waiter would make a noise under his breath and hesitate writing it down before finally saying he wouldn’t recommend the combination. Then we’d try another pair and he made another half-smile/half-grimace not sure whether to torpedo our bad selection again. Finally we asked him what to eat. That solved all our problems! And the food was stunning! Kevin had a “biran” (sort of like Indian biryani) with a side of deeply caramelized onions and I got a vegetable pilau with a spinach coconut curry-like thing. I found it so interesting how similar words were used to describe the rice dishes as one would use in North Indian cuisine, but were still different in both preparation and taste. Very delicious!</p>

<p>Continuing our food adventures, we visited a night market in Zanzibar which was packed with tourists and locals alike and was probably the most similar to Istanbul with street stalls shoulder to shoulder with rotating vertical spits offering shawarma and large grills offering a variety of meats and seafoods. Before indulging in more food, we wandered around the edge of the water watching young boys leap off the walls to dive into the water. One particularly memorable young man had a light cloth that he tied around his shoulders like a cape and as he leaped off the edge, yelled “HELICOPTER!” twisting as he descended. These guys looked like they were having a blast, jumping off over and over again as the sun set. After watching for a bit, we eventually meandered over to the stall and tried “Zanzibar pizza” which is sort of like a stuffed paratha but with a much thinner crust and served with many sauces. We topped that off with yummy Italian gelato. Earlier in the day, I had tried to visit a popular street cart that was famous for its chai called <em>Babu Chai</em> (Babu mean grandfather). You had the option of ginger chai or masala chai and sometimes he might serve <em>chapatis</em> with egg as a snack. He opened at 6pm, though you couldn’t get the chai until 6:30pm because it takes 30 minutes to brew with all the spices. Sadly, the owner was on holiday in Dar Es Salaam, but we found a small stand at the market claiming to be also “Babu Chai” and served exactly those two chai options. It was pretty good, but I’m not convinced it was the real thing since not very many others were partaking, and the original Babu Chai is quite popular as a post-work hangout spot. Also it wasn’t as strong as I would like it. I like <em>really</em> strong tea; I grew up spoiled by my dad who brews the most flavorful cardamom and ginger tea that I’ve ever had in my life so he has set the bar really high for me.</p>

<p>After two days, we rented a 4x4 and started driving north on the island, passing through the center of the island that is known for its spice farms. Clove production is incredibly important for Tanzania. It is its primary spice export and farms that produce cloves are treated very well by the government in Tanzania. While there are true spice farms that are focused on farming and export, the area has a few touristic spice farms that serve to be more educational to tourists and they plant small plots of many different kinds of spices close to each other. We had an incredible visit to one with a guide who spent three hours with us to teach us about cinnamon, clove, bananas, cassava, vanilla, coconut, grapefruit, mango, baobab, lemongrass, pineapple, papaya and so many more spices, fruits, and vegetables that grows on their small family farm. He taught us about how each of these plants are used not only for food, but also how the locals might use other parts of each plant (i.e. the leaves or the roots) for medicinal purposes. One thing I found remarkable was how much overlap there was with certain things I was told as a child on how people from my parents’ villages in India used the same plants for the exact same purpose: for example, cloves used as a way to alleviate toothaches because of its numbing properties. We were treated to a finale with one of the men on the farm climbing a coconut tree, using just a small rope made with dried and twisted banana leaves to provide friction so that he could climb up. He proceeded to sing and do tricks like holding on to the coconut tree trunk and lifting his legs in the air. Incredible agility! At the end of the tour, we ate cucumbers, watermelon, bananas, and other fruit to our hearts’ content. We also purchased a bunch of spices including “biran” spice mix so that we can try cooking some of the local food ourselves. Also I purchased a few vanilla beans to try to make vanilla extract when I get back to Ohio. I couldn’t believe it; they grow the Madagascar vanilla variety and these beans looked like Grade A beans which are quite expensive to buy usually.</p>

<p>After the spice tour, we continued our drive to Nungwi Beach at the north end of Zanzibar island. It was a pretty quiet area with a beachfront restaurant one minute walk away. The first night, we walked into the more bustling part of town via the roads that did not match Google Maps but then realized the best way to get around was to walk straight to the beach and follow the coastline until we were roughly close to where we want to go more inland. We found a cute food stall area serving everything from pizzas and nachos and curries which was a nice change of pace from what we had been eating recently. </p>

<p>The following day, we did our final excursion in Zanzibar which was something called “Zanzibuggy.” Essentially we got to drive around ATVs throughout the island, getting to visit the nearby villages and just generally have fun driving around a crazy machine. We got picked up by riding on the back of a motorcycle from our lodge because we messed up getting to the starting location. While Kevin was getting shepherded, I talked a little with our guide who spoke a little about the local villages’ life including that coffee is not at all drunk by the local people in Zanzibar. It’s all just tea. Coffee was introduced largely to appease tourists and the only time that coffee might be drunk by locals is when there might be a movie night at a neighbor’s house (with the TV placed outside) and maybe some hot coffee might be offered as a special movie night thing. We learned more about the village diet which includes at least a half dozen types of starches (yams, sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, cassava, colocasia, taro, and more) which are dominant because they grow well in the rocky soil that is slightly inland on the northern part of the island. We visited a small village and saw homes built from various material types: homes with more metal did a poorer job of keeping cool in the heat versus homes built from mud bricks. We visited an area where men were creating nails for <em>dhows</em> using salvaged rebars. I made an attempt at making one but I missed the hammer point about half the time and I think the other guy did most of the work. We had young children trailing us the entire time while we were touring the village who were extremely excited by the strange looking visitors. Even while driving, many children would run out of their homes and come to the edge of the road and wave as we passed through. After our tour, we got transported by motorcycle back to our digs; our guide tried to give us the what he called “African style” experience with three people on a motorcycle but the owner sadly didn’t let us.</p>

<p>My attempt to make a dhow nail. Not very good!</p>

We were very dusty and dirty afterwards!

</figcaption>

<p>We ended our day by eating delicious poke bowls at our lodge’s restaurant where a, what I thought, sweet kitten curled up on my lap. Until Kevin’s poke bowl arrived and she very was close to pouncing right into the bowl, pawing, meowing, and stretching to try to get at the food. What a turnaround! She turned in an instant from a sweet angelic cat to a demon cat! Her mom had an alternative technique which was to sit perfectly still and angelic next to someone until they would be swooned into giving her food. </p>

<p>We finally ended our Zanzibar trip by having an eventful drive back to the airport. At one point there was a complete blockage in the road because of some construction vehicles and a guy on a bicycle waved at us to follow up. We weren’t sure at first what he was trying to communicate so we tried to go around ourselves but he kept yelling and insisting at us to follow him so I turned and drove straight into his village’s grassy fields. He got on his bicycle and motioned to continue to follow him and my goodness I was so glad we rented a 4x4 because he was just taking us through some random fields with trees and gardens all around, occasionally with some gravel thrown in for what I assume is a walking path. Eventually he cycled between a coconut tree and a grass field where I thought, there was no way I can squeeze this car through that but he patiently waiting and directed until I miraculously squashed it through. I swear, my vehicle must have turned into the Knight bus to make it through. A real Knight bus would have been so helpful here. And then we popped on the other end of the construction vehicles and I drove us back onto something that had more of a semblence to road before continuing our journey onwards to the airport. Thank you bicycle man! I feel like throughout our travels, I have been learning to drive in increasingly chaotic conditions and now, I can drive in countries where road signs and lane markings are more like suggestions and one just needs to be hyperaware at all times about the bicycles, bikes, cars, buses, carts, and who knows what else with said vehicles having far more cargo either piled horizontally or vertically than would be considered reasonable in the west. </p>

Can I drive a car through that walking path? Turns out the answer is yes! PC: Kevin

<p>We made it safely to the airport and returned our substantially more dusty vehicle and took a very short flight onwards to the Arusha where we’d start the first of our three African safaris. But that’s for another post! :)</p>
