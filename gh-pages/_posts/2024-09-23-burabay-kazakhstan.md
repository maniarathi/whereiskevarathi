Currently, I'm in a yurt. It's a very cozy yurt with lots of rugs all over the place, bean bags scattered along the perimeter, and four stuffed animals (an octopus, a cat, a fox? maybe?, and a classic bear) plopped around the central thick rug that will be our mattress tonight. We're on an eight day tour of the Almaty region, exploring the canyons, mountains, lakes, and waterfalls in the area. Before we flew to Almaty from Astana, we spent a couple days in a place called Burabay (or "Borovoy" in Russian) to warm up our hiking legs and enjoy the incoming fall season away from the city.

Burabay is quite well situated for Astana city dwellers. It was a quick three hour train ride from one of the two major train stations in Astana and from the Burabay station, we took a taxi to our apartment for the two days which was near a different lake. The area really feels like Bariloche, Argentina in many ways; there is a network of several lakes in the region and the area is known for being a weekend getaway to enjoy nature, ride bikes, paddle out on the lakes in boats, and hike in the hills. And that's exactly what we did.

After getting into Burabay, initially we had planned to just go down the visitor's center and plan for a full following day and perhaps get in a little paddling. Our hostess was very enthusiastic and after a miscommunication about when we were planning on hiking, she ushered us into her car along with her mom and took us straight into the park and dropped us off at a trail head. She was an incredibly welcoming host, pointing out other locations that we should explore and offering to pick us up after we were done hiking as well. She did all of this while it was the middle of a working day for her.

The first hiking area was very cool! At the base, there was a monument whose purpose we still don't know. Right behind the monument was the beginning of a forest through which we hiked in order to get to a viewpoint or observation desk; at the beginning, we couldn't tell what the icon on our maps meant. These are probably some of the first hiking trails we've done this year where AllTrails doesn't have a route and so we were just scrambling up the forested hill in the vague direction of the eye icon. Eventually we found out that we went the wrong way and there was an actual, non-slip trail to the observation deck. We hiked a little past the observation deck into some rocky outcroppings where we had a gorgeous view of the hills and thick forest on the other side of the valley.

We did a second hike that day for a short sunset hike, also straight up a hill onto a flat rocky area that had beautiful panoramic views of the national park, especially the lakes. Both hikes were pretty short but it was nice to get out in nature and move on our own two feet again after what feels like quite a bit of time.

Kevin and I were talking about this recently: Kazakhstan has felt like a very relaxed country to visit thus far. The people here have been very kind, welcoming, and curious. Even if folks don't speak English, most people are very comfortable using Google Translate to communicate with us. While bargaining is standard for almost everything, it doesn't feel like we're starting off with extremely inflated "tourist" prices in the way that is common in many parts of Africa and transactions don't feel stressful. For sure, Kazakhstan is a much wealthier country than others we have visited due to oil and gas reserves so that certainly accounts for a great deal of the difference. But also I think that the people enjoy having visitors and want to make sure they leave with a positive impression. Just today, we gave a short ride to a couple of men from the Kazakhstan armed forces and with their very limited English, asked us if we liked Kazakhstan. A few hours later, the owner of a gas station where we were topping off our tank asked if we could take a picture with him. Burabay really felt like a charming quiet place where all these characteristics of the country met.

While we ended up doing more on the first day than expected, we had a second full day in Burabay as well. This time, we rented some bicycles from a place in town and biked along a path that was especially constructed for bikes along the perimeter of one of the lakes. We took the bikes out to a trailhead for _Kenesary's Cave_ which had some of the most confusing mile markers I have ever seen. We couldn't tell whether the trail was five kilometers roundtrip or point-to-point after attempting to translate the board at the start of the hike but our phone tracker told us it was neither and rather around eight or nine kilometers instead. It was a funny little hike with various objects and monuments next to the trail that were all detailing life milestones of a man named Kenesary Khan who was the last _khan_ (a Kazakh monarch) of the Kazakh Khanate and led one of the first attempts to free Kazakhstan from Russian rule. The hike led to a small cave where Kenesary once rested during hunts. It's a small thing with a nice view, but the hike through the birch trees with the leaves changing color was really peaceful and quiet and we loved it. The whole area is just absolutely gorgeous right now. The leaves are all turning vibrantly yellow and orange and red and the skies are clear and it's not yet too cold with some days still warm enough to wear shorts and a tee.

After our hike, we headed out a little further to a small "waterfall" in a creek that was gently flowing through the birch tree forest. It was just really nice to be outside in perfect weather; the shoulder season between summer and fall keeps the temperature warm enough to avoid a jacket but cool enough that biking and hiking doesn't result in turning into puddles. We headed back after this stop, pausing along the lakefront to take some gorgeous photos of the sun going down and the vibrantly colored leaves. We got ourselves into a small pickle by accidentally turning onto a footpath rather than staying on the designated bike path and had to haul our bikes up and down some steps before pushing our bikes up and over a stone wall back onto a road.

We returned to our apartment and had a relaxed evening before heading back to the train station the following morning. Our wonderful host was kind enough to give us a ride to the station in her brother's work van. There was a couple in our train car that was really friendly and tried to talk to us but didn't speak a word of English. I think they were traveling from Burabay to go and see a concert somewhere close to the city because the guy enthusiastically was showing us some Youtube clips of a performer. We rolled into Nur Sultan 1 and took a taxi to the airport where we burned a few hours before our flight to Almaty. And that wrapped up our Burabay trip and our first part of our Kazakhstan travels. It was really such a beautiful, relaxed, and lovely excursion from the city! Currently, we are on a roadtrip in the Almaty area (part two) and followign Almaty, we'll be flying to our final area of Kazakhstan which is Aktau. The country is so big!
