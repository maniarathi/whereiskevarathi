I've been procrastinating a bit on writing this post because I've been slightly nervous about having to sort through all the pictures from our very brief visit to Rwanda and Uganda. We were really only there for about four days primarily to embark on our last of three safaris to visit the primates living in the densely forested mountains across the borders of Rwanda, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo. I had set my camera to burst mode in order to try to improve the odds that some of my pictures of the zipping simians might actually turn out sharp. The result of that is that I had somewhere on the order of four hundred pictures from four days that I had to sort through and I was a bit intimidated by the slow process, especially when I was only using my iPad. I've made significant progress on the project now, mainly due to a) switching to my laptop and b) having plane time to do some of the processing in phases. Now my challenge will be not to upload too many to this blog post, especially now that I've realized I can create galleries in my blogs now that I can use the full web version of Squarespace. Ah, the double edged sword of technology. 

We arrived in Kigali, Rwanda from Nairobi and honestly, I was surprised by how modern the city was. We spent the evening at a California-chic cafe where I was able to eat _tofu_, a food I have not seen, let alone eaten since we were in Western Europe. We saw that there were a few other groups at the cafe using the spot as a work cafe; there were two (perhaps Australian based on the accent?) ladies working on a work presentation whom we had to ask to borrow their Deet spray as we were seated in a gorgeous garden outside and mosquitoes were feasting on our exposed skin. The city of Kigali itself reminds me a lot of Medellin; it is sprawled across a mountainous area with modern skyscrapers dotting the crests of the hills. It's a dense city with the roads filled with motorcycle taxis who carry extra helmets for their paying passengers. As we had heard, Kigali is in fact an extremely clean city with little to no trash resting on sidewalks or in the creases of curbs. There are sidewalks. Rwanda also has banned plastic bags since 2008; this was something we were quite nervous about because we heard that there are strict penalties for bringing in plastic bags and we have lots of them to carry spillable toiletries, dirtied hiking shoes, and other random things like a small plastic bag to keep all my jewelry together. We ended up getting rid of all of the extra Ziplocs we had on hand that we keep in case of emergency, but hoped for the best for the ones that we couldn't figure out another method. Ultimately it was fine; I think as long as there isn't an intention to _dispose_ of the plastic bags you bring into the country, you're free to bring them in and then take them out.

After one night in Kigali, we immediately set off for our four day safari with our Ugandan driver named Gard (\*not sure about the spelling) showing up bright and early the next day. Our first stop was at the Kigali Genocide Memorial. I'm sitting here unsure about how to write about this awful awful thing that happened within my lifetime that resulted in the deaths of around 800,000 souls. I won't be able to do the history of it justice but if you have time, I would recommend [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide) about this terrible atrocity. The memorial itself is very hard to visit. The stories of the people who perished and the stories told by survivors, the photos and videos, and visiting the graves that each hold around 100,000 people was a moving experience. There were some videos that I could not watch. I was constantly pinching myself to try to prevent myself from crying. There are a few things that stood out to me though. First, the exhibits did a good job of explaining how radicalism through fear became the powerful engine that eventually motivated and, for those who participated, _justified_ such an atrocity. Those who are in positions of leadership, who choose to prey on and exploit human fear in order to push their agenda, are, in my mind, terrible humans. Second, the Western world watched and sat on their hands while this happened. There are many reasons why, including overcautiousness in getting involved in another country's conflict after some backlash in an earlier conflict in Somalia, but none seem reasonable in retrospect. The memorial dedicates a portion of the memorial to installations that discuss other genocides including the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Cambodian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide), the [Bosnian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_genocide), and the [Herero and Namaqua Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Nama_genocide) in Namibia. The memorial is much more than a memorial; it is the resting place for many of the victims of the genocide, but also does research to understand the commonalities between genocides over history, understand why they happened, and runs campaigns to prevent genocides from happening again. It also provides support for survivors and for communities that were destroyed by genocide. Visiting the memorial is a must if you happen to ever be in Rwanda. I think it gives some perspective on how impressively well the country is doing and how quickly it is making economic progress given the context of how recently they went through the lowest point in their country's history. 

The Genocide Memorial was pretty much the only major thing we did in Rwanda. From there, Gard drove us onwards to Uganda close to the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park where we would be trekking the following day to track and view Golden Monkeys. I was very impressed with Gard's driving and his ability to easily switch from the right hand side driving in Rwanda to the left hand side driving in Uganda. In Rwanda, the roads are more like how one would drive in the US with speed limits that drivers are expected to adhere to. In Uganda, the drivers appear not to be trusted with speed limits so the roads are full of speed bumps that force a slow speed. Gard navigated the roads effortlessly (except one blip at the end when he got a bit lost on the last day driving us to the airport in Kigali, but nothing a quick navigation on Google Maps couldn't fix!). The safaris in Uganda/Rwanda are interesting from a pricing standpoint; gorilla trekking permits costs seven hundred US dollars per person in Uganda (fifteen hundred if you decide to do it in Rwanda) so it naturally means that the average client doing this type of safari is well-off and so other aspects of the trip, including accommodation, tend to be quite nice. The permits are so expensive to help curb over tourism; of the thirty-six or so human-habituated gorilla families, eleven are visited by groups of eight tourists for one hour each day. Rwanda has fewer habituated gorilla families so their permits are even more expensive. It is also possible to do gorilla trekking in DRC at a much lower cost (~four hundred dollars per permit) but it also comes with a risk of [getting kidnapped](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2024/03/28/drc-people-and-animals-threatened-by-fighting-in-virunga-park_6661928_124.html) so, you know, probably not the best choice.

Hiking towards the golden monkeys in Mgahinga.

</figcaption>

Our first day in Uganda was spent tracking golden monkeys in the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. Both golden monkey tracking and mountain gorilla tracking work the same way. We and the other clients arrive at the national park early in the morning. Before we arrive, a group of trackers employed by the National Park will head into the mountains to go and find the primate families. They typically have a good sense of where the families are because they keep track of where they were last seen the night before. From that location, they can track food remains, poop, and tracks to figure out what direction the families might have moved overnight. While the trackers are doing that, we first are greeted with song and dance by the local communities who used to live in the national park areas (once an area becomes a national park, people can no longer live there so the government will try their best to support the people who end up getting displaced). Then we get briefed about the rules around visiting the monkeys or gorillas. The rules are all obvious ones with the only slightly interesting one being that everyone needs to wear face masks once we actually see the primates. This is because it is easy to transfer diseases between us and them. Following the safety briefing, all the visitors are divided into groups of eight and each group is assigned a primate family to track, a lead employed by the national park as well as additional trackers who are in communication with the trackers out in the field to figure out where to hike. Then we start walking. I've heard that sometimes the primate families are assigned based on the estimated fitness level of the group so that more fit groups are asked to hike out to the further families but it seemed like it was pretty arbitrary. There's an option of the "African helicopter" where one can be fully carried on a semi-seated-stretcher-like contraption the entirety of the trek and back; it's cool that they've found a way to make the experience accessible for those with more limited mobility and the money goes directly back to the communities.

We hiked about two hours to find the golden monkeys. The hike itself was really beautiful with lovely views of the Virunga Mountains, shared by Rwanda, Uganda, and DRC. There are also three inactive volcanoes in the park which our guide pointed out to us as we trekked. We didn't have to do much bushwacking and rather stuck to well trodden trails for the hike which was pretty nice. In what felt like no time at all, we got to the golden monkeys and had a fantastic time watching them fly through the trees! The golden monkeys were really active and mostly high in the trees, nibbling away at something or other. They were really fun to watch and there were more than one hundred in our designated family! It's really incredible to watch their interactions and see the similarities to us humans. Except they way they leap through the trees; that is most definitely very un-human.

Our hour passed in a snap and we headed back to the entrance. We passed through a really lovely bamboo forest area and managed to do a sort of a loop so that we didn't have to go exactly back the way we came. Apparently finding the monkeys in about two hours was really fast and we were the first group back; all the safari drivers were off somewhere chilling and when we returned to the parking lot, we all were sort of wandering around trying to find our drivers and guides. Because we finished so quickly, we ended up having a fairly relaxed evening at our hotel which was good because we had an early start the next day.

Kevin took this amazing video of the golden monkeys leaping through the trees!

Both Kevin and I were very excited for mountain gorilla tracking. A few of the folks whom we hiked with for golden monkey tracking told us a bit about their experience with the gorillas (they were starting their safari from Kampala instead of Kigali) and it sounded just incredible. I really appreciated Gard's attentiveness to making sure we always got to places either on time or early. We were some of the first ones ready to go at Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park. It made for a relaxing experience with plenty of time to prepare ourselves before we got started hiking. This hike ended up being kind of funny. We first drove to a different trailhead away from the national park entrance. We lingered around the trailhead for quite some time because there were two possible paths we could have taken but the trackers weren't sure which one to take. Part of the reason was because there was poor cellphone connection between the trackers in the field and the trackers with us. Another was that (and we found this out later) the gorilla family was on the move so they were rapidly changing their position. We waited around so that we'd have more certainty about which direction to go instead of tracking down one path and then backtracking to go a different way. I'm not sure how long we waited but eventually, we started going up one of the paths. This trek was a bit more challenging; they don't call it the "Impenetrable Forest" for nothing! There was still a visible trail but the leads out in front had to do a bit more whacking of the bushes and vines with their machetes. It was occasionally steep but at least it hadn't rained too much so it wasn't too muddy or slippery. We ended up not hiking very far before we paused again. Once again, the trackers with us were trying to figure out where the gorillas were headed. After another length of time, they had us turn back a few paces, take a right turn directly into the bushes and voila, there they were! We really only ended up actively hiking, maybe, around thirty minutes or less.

It really was such a cool experience to view these mountain gorillas. We saw a family of eight: one silverback (the alpha male), three adult females, three adolescents, and one baby. Most of the time, the gorillas were on the ground eating. The baby was hilarious to watch as he was the most active of all the gorillas and Kevin managed to take a great video (below!) of the baby accidentally falling out of a tree! Also, Kevin got pushed by one of the gorillas! We were watching a small group in front of us feed and a little while later, we heard a voice saying "there's a gorilla behind you." I turned around just in time to see a female gorilla, who was feeding behind us, decide to join the main group that we were watching in front of us and I managed to step out of her path just in time. Kevin was a little more in front of me and turned around only just enough to see there was a gorilla on his tail without any time to react. The gorilla gave him a big shove and continued her direct path to the group! Boy, I wish I had my video setting on to capture the moment. I was laughing so hard and Kevin looked so startled for a second. She definitely gave him a good push! At least it wasn't the silverback that shoved Kevin out of the way!

One interesting thing to watch was how the trackers communicated with the gorillas. Occasionally the silverback would grunt a bit and the trackers grunt back at an equal strength. My basic understanding is that it was a way to communicate in familiar terms to give a sense of security to the gorillas and prevent any aggression. To habituate a gorilla family for human visitors takes about two years and even after we left, a few trackers stayed behind and continued to track them over the course of the day. They even have veterinary centers to take care of gorillas in case they get hurt or ill. Because of their conservation efforts, the number of mountain gorillas is rising and moving in a positive direction away from the endangered species designation, now totalling more than one thousand.

After watching the gorillas, we headed to a gorgeous area of Uganda called Lake Bunyonyi. The drive to the lake itself was really beautiful. Uganda's land is undulating and the road winds through its rolling hills. Gard said that the mountains in Uganda are very fertile compared to the mountains in Rwanda which are too rocky to farm. Because of this fertile land, Ugandans produce enough food to feed the entire country (though the challenge of making sure the food actually reaches all the people still remains). We saw the land being tilled for planting long beans and tons of cabbage patches. They also produce all sorts of sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, and a particular grain called _sorghum_. I tried this grain with some barbecued tofu in Rwanda our first night; it's a pretty hearty grain that requires some jaw strength to chew through but it was tasty. As we got closer to the lake, we also saw more quarry mining and brick manufacturing. People would sit near the rocky hills adjacent to the road and mine the rocks by hand, breaking them into small pieces. These stones are commonly bought by real estate developers in order to build buildings in the area. We also saw huge piles of bricks that had been shaped and stacked in order to be fired into actual usable bricks.

We arrived at the lake's edge by car and hopped into a small boat that whisked us away to an island in the lake where our hotel was situated. The lake is incredibly peaceful and beautiful. We had a lovely evening spent on the terrace, staring at the lake while eating dinner with Gard. We exchanged stories about our lives and Gard told us how he's saving up to buy twenty cows so that he can marry his girlfriend. We really enjoyed Gard's company; he was closer to us in age than most other safari guides we've had in the past and I think that helped conversation flow easily. Gard himself is a very social and friendly person, offering to help anyone around (for example, since we had space in our car, he offered the gorilla trackers to hop into our car for a ride to the trail head).

The next day we did our final activity which was to canoe around the perimeter of the island in the lake in a Ugandan pirogue with oars that really looked more like spatulas. Gard took an embarrassing video of us completely failing at trying to paddle in a straight line and we nearly gave up getting around the lake when we got to the back side of the island and it felt like we were making zero forward progress against the wind. But we prevailed! We definitely provided some entertainment for the local folks who were either zipping around in their motor-powered boats or professionally handling their own canoe with ease. It was genuinely a lot of fun to paddle around and we got a good workout by the end. Afterwards, we packed up, piled our stuff back into a motor-powered boat that took us back to the mainland (with a brief stop to check out some zebras on a nearby island!). And then we headed to the airport! On the way, we did have one last stop to eat some "rolex" which was one Ugandan food I really wanted to try. This is something I will have to try to make for a quick lunch one day; it's just a thin omelet (add whatever fillings you want) stacked on a chapati and rolled up. You can eat it with a sweet chili sauce or ketchup or just plain. Simple and yummy!

We headed back to the States after this last safari for a wedding and to visit some family which was really nice. A random note, our layover in Nairobi was _fantastic_; we've been heavy users of lounges this year and the Nairobi lounge was amazing. The food was so good and they had fantastic showers, each one cleaned after every person. I packed my own towel and toiletries assuming I'd have to provide my own, but they gave me fresh towels, slippers, and toiletries. After a full delicious meal and a hot shower, Kevin and I both passed out fantastically on the plane, skipping all the meals and waking only close to landing. We've both gotten to be very good plane sleepers!

And that's it for our Africa leg! What a phenomenal time! I think it will be quite some time before we want to do another safari but we're so thankful to have had such incredible experiences. I just learned yesterday that it was lucky that we were able to go at all because both Rwanda and Uganda have been upgraded to "Level 3: Reconsider Travel" designations by the US State Department due to an outbreak of Marburg virus disease. I hope that the countries are able to contain the virus quickly so that more people can visit these amazing lands.

A fun side note: Chicago O’Hare is one of our favorite airports in the whole wide world. Why? Because they have a Sprinkles cupcake “ATM.” We _always_ get a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting to share and the “I love Sprinkles” song gets stuck in our head for days thereafter. It was our special treat for all the red eyes we took when flying from SFO to Columbus, since we would almost always pass through O’Hare around 4 or 5 in the morning and the ATM is located between the main B/C terminals where the big birds fly in (SFO -> ORD) and the dungeon terminals of E/F where the tiny planes get relegated (ORD -> CMH). THEY CHANGED THE ATM LOCATION THOUGH! We didn’t get a cupcake :( But there’s a happy ending to the story which is that we flew through ORD again the following day when we traveled to Montreal after picking up our fancy clothes in Columbus and I hunted down that ATM and we got our cupcake. 10 out of 10.
