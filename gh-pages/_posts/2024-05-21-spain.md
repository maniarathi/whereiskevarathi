My sister happened to be in Spain for vacation so I decided, after wrapping up our time in the Galápagos, to catch her at the tail end of her travels in Seville. Conveniently enough, it was straightforward to reach Madrid from Quito, Ecuador which was another plus. Kevin even flew through Madrid directly from Quito to reach Vienna where he was attending a conference.

Off to Seville from Madrid! I love trains, but especially high speed trains so much!

</figcaption>

Spain was quite the whirlwind for me. I spent a total of 10 nights in Spain with only the second and third night in the same location. Besides visiting my sister, I had two other aims: I had some errands to get done like buying new hiking shoes and I wanted to visit northern Spain based on a recommendation from a duo we met from Spain while on the O trek in Torres del Paine. 10 nights, 7 cities/towns, 4 trains, 3 hikes, and 1 vomit comet seems like a good way to sum up my Spanish experience.

Arriving in Spain was one of the weirdest travel experiences I’ve ever had. Flying from Quito to Madrid was a roughly 18 hour journey (including a layover in Bogota). With every other experience I’ve ever had involving 18 hours of travel, I usually end up in a place that speaks a completely different language. So after 18 hours when I stumbled off the plane and _continued_ to hear Spanish, that was jarring. Jarring enough that I remember feeling jarred after 18 hours and it takes a lot to jar me after that amount of travel time. Except this time, there was no more Kevin to aggressively nudge and panickedly whisper “WHAT DID THAT MEAN?” to understand what was going on. I was on my own.

After spending 6 hours in Madrid at a hostel to catch some sleep, I took a high speed train, racing off through the bountiful orange trees (I drank a lot of orange juice in Spain), and showed up at my sister and her boyfriend’s Airbnb in Seville. We spent a couple days visiting Itálica and Ronda together. Itálica was the location where scenes from Dorne in Game of Thrones were filmed (completely lost on me) but the ruins themselves were more expansive and more well preserved than I imagined. I especially liked seeing the intricate mosaics and the giant Colosseum-like structure that was used for similar purposes. Italica was a nice introduction to the three “eras” of Seville: first the period under Roman rule, then the conquest of the city by the Arabs and following rule, and finally the third age of rule under the Catholics. Itálica was entirely from the Roman period and later on, the context was helpful to place the dates and context for other structures in Seville proper.

Ronda was also very picturesque. We spent most of the time strolling around the city and visiting various famous landmarks, including a couple of very impressive bridges built over some deep gorges that cut through the city. The views from the bridges were gorgeous; even on the train ride from Madrid to Seville, I was blown away by the gentle green hills of Spain and endless seas of orange trees that were loaded with bright fruit (apparently the fruit is not very good to eat, though reasonable to make marmalade). Ronda boasted similar views which I thoroughly enjoyed drinking in. And it made me yearn to be back in the mountains again.

After parting ways with my sister and her boyfriend, I spent two more days in southern Spain. One to visit Seville proper (they had done that earlier in their trip so I missed seeing the city centre previously) and another day to visit Málaga, a larger coastal city nearby that was the birthplace of Picasso. I’ll drop some pictures below of some of my favorite highlights!

Train rides are helpful for lots of planning. For the most part, Kevin and I have been taking a pace of travel that is slower than what we would normally do when taking a vacation. Usually on a one or two week vacation, we jam pack as many highlights as possible and move around a lot night to night. For this year-long travel stint, we’re more likely to stay three or more nights in one place and have also exercised the option to extend our stay, as we did for Buenos Aires. Spain was a throwback to the old style of travel for me. At this point, a “normal” day in my life looked like waking up at 6 or 6:30am, dashing off to the train station, grabbing a breakfast pastry (usually croissant) and either a black tea or just hot water (I carry my own preferred tea bags) at the station, taking the train to a new city, plan for the next days on the train after sleeping for another 30 minutes, explore new city, sleep, and repeat. It worked out pretty well actually and I have to say again, I LOVE TRAINS! So comfy, pretty solid wifi, and I can read and/or get things done without getting motion sickness (I can’t read on car rides). And of course, gorgeous views. In Spain, I primarily stayed at hostels since I’m on my own and hostels have the benefit of having a kitchen so that I can cook dinner myself instead of eating out all the time. It was a nice way to meet new people as well; I met one guy in Madrid from San Luis Obispo who had just finished the epic [Camino de Santiago trek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago), some 800+ kilometres, and showed me the Latin scrolls that he got for finishing. They looked so awesome, very diploma-like. 800 kilometres definitely scares me a bit though — he’d been trekking for close to 2 months!!

Following a brief stop in Madrid to restock (I needed new hiking boots), I decided to visit the Picos de Europa in northern Spain. Northern Spain has _so much_ to offer if you like outdoorsy activities. It was a bit difficult to choose what to do, but I decided on Picos de Europa because a) it was accessible with a direct train from Madrid to Santander, b) I found [a really nice blog post](https://www.packing-up-the-pieces.com/picos-de-europa-national-park/) with an itinerary that spanned the amount of time I had left in Spain before reuniting with Kevin and c) that’s where one of Spain’s most famous hikes was located called Ruta del Cares and I wanted to do that.

</figcaption>

I wonder when I will stop saying this phrase, maybe never, but the Picos blew. me. away. I just love being in the mountains so much and after a bit of time in the cities that were already filling up with summertime vacationers, I was really looking forward to being in a quieter place. Don’t get me wrong, Seville and Malága were _very_ nice, but at some point, I was a bit tired of not being able to visit sites as I wished (tickets are required for _everything_ and they book out weeks in advance in the summertime) and it felt odd to me to hear more English than Spanish as I wandered the streets. With the Picos, it felt like I had found the place that the Spanish themselves escape to during the sweltering summer months as it’s much more tolerably warm and there are so many hikes that you can easily be completely alone if you choose. 

\>

![](assets/img/spain/P5100049_Original.jpeg)

I ended up doing three hikes in my time in the Picos. The first one was a beautiful downhill hike that begins at the top of a cable car called Fuente Dé. The cable car ride alone was magical; you get sweeping views of the limestone peaks of the Picos and towards the end, the cable car is lifted nearly vertically against a sheer cliff to its destination. The hike down took me along the backside of the mountains with, again, more sweeping views, a few curious goats, and a few straggling bits of snow.

The second hike was the famous [Ruta del Cares](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cares_Trail). Getting to the trailhead was quite an adventure alone; it turns out that Google Maps has a hard time figuring out which paths are for cars and which ones are for hikers. On the way to Caín, where I started the hike, I turned off the main road into what seemed like an awfully narrow gravel “road” obeying Google Maps’ orders. A few meters in, I thought, boy this seems really wrong and I backed out and realized I’d been driving on a hiking trail! Oops!! Luckily, I was able to back out onto the main road without too much trouble and bonus, a little down the road there was a sign that pointed out “Caín a coche” (to Caín by car). Thank goodness I knew what the Spanish word for “car” was. Google Maps led me down another hiking trail later on in the drive, but at least this time I knew to be aware and was able to look at the map on my phone to figure out which way to go.

The beginning of the Cares trails took me through some tunnels and caves nestled in the canyon.

</figcaption>

After just a few steps into the hike, I understood why the Cares trail is one of the most famous hikes in all of Spain. This trail is 22 kilometres of ridge hiking along a canyon with enormous cliff drops and breathtaking views of the mountains between the gap. It’s a there-and-back trail but the views were different in both directions. I got very lucky with the weather; I tried to start as early as possible because I knew it was going to rain in the afternoon, and rain it did in the last few kilometres. The part that was a little scary though was the claps of thunder and flashes of lightning that lasted about 20 minutes as I started the return part of the hike from Poncebos. There’s nothing like spotting the zigzag of lightning flashing in the sky to quicken the pace of a hike. Thankfully there was no accompanying downpour so I was happy to take the little drizzle whose fog produced a very cool aura for the last bit of the hike.

Just breathtaking views the whole way. You can see how the trail snakes across the canyon ridge with limestone shooting up on either side.

The third and final hike I did was from the Covadonga Lakes, further west in the Picos in the Asturias region (the Picos are split across two regions of Spain: Asturias and Cantabria) called “Mirador de Ordiales”. I parked my car in the town of Cangas de Onís where I was spending the night and because of the high season, took the mandatory bus to the lakes. It was probably best that I could not drive myself because not only are the roads narrow and windy, but there was a thick layer of fog that was sitting heavily across the lakes region and I could barely even see my hand if I stuck it out in front. At this point, I was unsure about whether I would do the hike at all because I could not see anything at all; at one point, after getting off the bus, I was standing adjacent to one of the lakes on the bank and I couldn’t see the water right below. 

\>

![](assets/img/spain/P5120003_Original.jpeg)

<figcaption>

This was after the fog had _improved_. At least I could see out a little further at this point. On the way back I realized that the Picos were right in front of me the whole time, but can’t see them here!

</figcaption>

In any case, since it was the morning, I decided to go for the hike. I figured that there was a good chance that the fog might burn off later in the day and worst case, I could turn back after a few kilometres and just take the next bus back to the city. The hike I did is not the most popular thing to do at the lakes; there are several other smaller strolls to view the lakes and old churches nearby and in fact, I only ever ended up seeing one of the lakes as the trail started by tracing half of the circumference of Lake Enol.

\>

![](assets/img/spain/P5120005_Original.jpeg)

<figcaption>

There were lots and lots of cows on this trail and I had to be careful where I stepped. I like this picture because you can see the fog that I had just finished walking through and had gained enough altitude to be above the fog.

</figcaption>

Luckily, my bet paid off. After getting to the other side of Enol, for another 3 kilometres, the trail is just a gravel road and that part was pretty boring since I couldn’t see a thing. Just as I finished the first 4 kilometres and all of the gravel road, I could start to see just the smallest amounts of greenery hinting at more grand landscapes. The fog continued to burn off as I hiked and I was treated to a huge variety of terrains and landscapes from meadows with shocking blue flowers, the memorable “poop zone” where hundreds of cows were relieving themselves after breakfast, the ascents through loose limestone in the final parts of the hike.

I _almost_ missed the actual mirador though. At the end of the trail as marked by AllTrails, there was a gap between two stones that opened up to beautiful panorama views of the Picos (and a sheer drop to who-knows how many feet below). I decided to settle there for my late lunch. There happened to be another small group nearby on one of the scrambles to my right and after finishing lunch when the group had left, I decided, why not go and check out that view too? Well, _that_ was the mirador. Holy macaroni. I thought I got “panorama” with my lunch view, but the top of that rock had a more than 180 degree view. I could see the ground below and not only the famous limestone peaks but also greener peaks, though all still striped with the last lingering bits of snow.

After having my fill of that beautiful mirador, I made my way back down to the parking lot. Because so much of my hike had been blanketed with fog on the way up, it felt like a brand new hike coming back down. So much more to see! I enjoyed the grassy areas of hiking that provided some relief to my feet as I approached finishing around 60 kilometres of hiking in 3 days.

Well I was definitely feeling those 60 kilometres by the end of the hike. I ended up finishing a bit earlier than expected around 6pm and had an hour to kill before my bus back to the city at 7pm. I collapsed onto a bench, vaguely staring at some cows who had made their way to the parking lot, jingling their cow bells. I was not feeling so good at this point in that I had run through all my water and was feeling a little headachy. Without getting into too many more gory details, let’s just say that a growing headache plus the hairpin turns of the mountains (to be fair, the bus driver was incredibly gentle about navigating the turns which is an unusual experience) led to me fully lose my lunch in some bushes at the bus station parking lot. I was very grateful and lucky that I was an 8 minute walk away from my hotel room. I just needed to wait a little bit for ibuprofen number one to kick in so that I could stumble there and one more hour of sleep after ibuprofen number two did the trick to relive the whole situation). A good night’s sleep and I was back to normal!

Cangas de Onís.

</figcaption>

And that was the memorable ending to my Spain hiking adventures! The next day I drove from Cangas de Onís to Bilbao for a flight to Paris to meet up with Kevin again. One last quick story about Bilbao; as I was driving into Bilbao, I realized that I was starting to see the letter “x” in words which I thought, weird, I didn’t think Spanish used the letter “x” either in Spain Spanish or various South American dialects. The word for “airport” had also changed. It was now “aireportua.” At this point, I had already gone through a grief cycle as I realized that the Spanish words I had learned in Argentina and Chile were useless in Spain (e.g. parking is “estacionamiento” in South America but “aparcamiento” in Spain Spanish) so I was wondering what on earth had happened now. I figured probably another dialect but was a bit surprised since I had barely driven 2 hours east. I stopped by the gas station near the airport to fill up the rental car and when I went inside to pay, I had a short conversation with the cashier who asked a few questions like where I was from which I answered in my rudimentary Spanish. Only after settling back into my car did I realize that I actually _understood everything he said_. What?! Usually I can understand one sentence or two, but not a whole conversation and at some point I would have to switch to English again.

Turns out, the language was Basque from which some French is derived. I assume I was able to understand because of similar root words but that was a pleasant surprise. Once I got to the airport, it was much more clear as signs were predominantly written in Basque with translations underneath in Spanish and English. Good practice as my next stop was Paris to meet up with Kevin again! It’s funny that so far, our travels have taken us to locations where either one of us has some knowledge about the spoken language.

One day I would love to return to northern Spain. The area is truly a hiking paradise and I barely scratched the surface of what the region has to offer. The whole Asturias and Cantabria regions are unique and I didn’t get as much of a chance to explore the tiny towns after being so tired out from hiking. I would definitely recommend the Picos de Europa as a way to balance out a visit to the more bustling cities. But until then, au revoir!
