I’m currently sitting in a large tent that looks like the Bedouin tent that we stopped by earlier for tea. We’re on the third day of our trek from Dana to Petra which will take us a total of five days. We ended up at our camp a little earlier than the previous two nights which has allowed me some time to hang out at the tent, having had a fresh shower (and I washed my hair!). As per Jordanian custom, I’ve been offered tea twice in the time I have written these last few words by two different people. I finally feel comfortable declining at least just with the folks who are part of our trek; it is black tea sweetened with as much sugar as pop and I’ve already had about five cups today as well as about two tablespoons of Arabic coffee and I am hoping to sleep tonight (and now that I write that, I realize how futile this hope might be). Jordanian hospitality is on another level; I’ve really loved how welcoming everyone has been and how each camp eagerly says “welcome to Jordan” and “please feel like this is your home.” I am going to definitely miss Jordan once we leave in a few days!

Kevin and I found out about this trek through a [National Geographic site](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/world-hikes) that listed the top 15 original treks in the world. The full Jordan Trail actually runs from the top of the country to the bottom and takes forty-two days to complete. We’re doing just a portion of it that begins in the Dana Biosphere Reserve, where we were briefly towards the end of our road trip, and ends by walking through the backdoor of Petra. We thought it would be a cool experience to walk into the Nabataean Kingdom's capital, walking parts of the ancient routes that traders took to enter the city themselves, more than a thousand years ago.

With us, we have a wonderful group of trekking companions. Munthar is our trekking guide and absolutely loves geology but is amazingly well versed in botany, zoology, history, and so many other subjects. Maria and Christian are from the Seattle area and are also on a travel break though they’re a bit further along than us, having already finished one full year. For them, their travel break is coming to a close as they are planning on returning to Seattle to visit their families for the holidays. Esther is a wonderful woman who actually lives in Amman and has been there for one year. She is a statistician and has worked in many countries, including Tanzania and India. She is originally from the UK and her work is inspiring as she does data analysis on the Syrian refugees who live in Jordan to help the government make decisions. And finally, for one day, we had Vera. Vera lives in Switzerland and is Munthar’s girlfriend. They actually met about a year ago, doing the section of the Jordan Trail hike from Petra to Wadi Rum. When October 7th happened, everyone else who was scheduled for the trek dropped out except for Vera and since then, they’ve been in a long distance relationship. Unfortunately she ended up having to head back to Switzerland for work after one day but we really enjoyed having her on the trail and it’s amazing how quickly we all got along!

We all met each other at a hotel/camp that was coincidentally right next to the hotel/camp the first time Kevin and I stayed a couple nights in Dana. It had an equally beautiful view and we loved the home cooked spread they set out for us for dinner. The night was pretty uneventful as Munthar briefed us about the following day and handed us a really nice package of a canvas tote with the trail map, reusable sporks, a stainless steel cup, and a buff. Later on, I would realize exactly how much I appreciated those items (like the buff for the crazy winds we would experience later!) but in general, I really liked how much emphasis the trek already had on trying to be kind to the environment.

**Day 1**

The thing that I learned today is that tetra paks of hummus need to exist all over the world and I will figure out a way to a) make top tier hummus and b) find reusable packets that act like tetra paks. Munthar brought out a big stainless steel plate of things that we could pick and choose from to turn into a lunch including tetra paks of hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, pita bread, cans of tuna, and maamouls (a sort of cookie with a date paste filling that amusingly called it “date pasta” on the ingredient list). Vera later showed us how to tear off a small corner of the tetra pak and squeeze the hummus directly on whatever vehicle we chose (i.e.  vegetable or bread). She said that every time she returns to Switzerland from Jordan, she fills her suitcase with hummus tetra paks and za’atar. 

This hiking day was a nice easy start to the trek and there were some similarities to the hike we had previously done on our own. We descended directly down into the valley, passing by the white domes we had walked through earlier, and traced the dry riverbed of the wadi all the way to Feynan Ecolodge where we broke for lunch. Lunch was a challenge as the cats started swarming around all those tuna cans and we all spent equal amounts of time taking bites of food and swatting cats, especially one persistent one who would leap onto the table. 

Munthar had endless information about the flora and fauna of the area, telling us about both the scientific knowledge of the plants and also how the Bedouins use various plants for medicinal purposes. I managed to get some beautiful shots of some birds this first day that I’m super proud of.

Munthar let us know that because of incoming strong winds, we had to abort our plans to camp for the night. He rerouted us to a small sheltered area where there were stone cabins set up and a separate sheltered area for the kitchen, dining, and sleeping for the staff. As we approached camp, a small boy met us with a huge grin on his face. His name was Ayoub and he was the young son of the cook, Mustafa, who was eagerly waiting to see Munthar. I really enjoyed watching Munthar toss Ayoub onto his shoulder and walk into camp as the sun slowly started to set. After quickly dropping our bags, we climbed a small nearby hill to sit and watch the sun fully go down. I always find it funny how it looks like the sun has set when you’re low and there are hills in the distance and suddenly, the sun appears to be rising as you quickly go up a hill. And then you get a second sunset!

\>

<figcaption>

Off into the sunset!

</figcaption>

The cabins were pretty basic (just two mattresses on the floor), but the highlight was just being around such friendly company. We loved sharing a meal with the rest of our trekking group and the food was absolutely delicious. I could barely hold in my laughter as Ayoub tried to keep up with the adults with tea drinking and on his second glass, he would take a big gulp and look around a bit helplessly before spitting it back into the cup and trying again. He eventually succeeded! That boy had endless energy (even besides the caffeinated beverages), running up and down the sunset hill and between the valleys before running back to camp upon his dad’s summon. 

They weren’t wrong about the wind. It definitely picked up by the time dinner rolled around with us having to fight the door from swinging wildly open. I was impressed; when we passed by our initial planned campsite earlier, I thought that the wind wasn’t too bad, but the crew was spot on with the wind howling as the night progressed. We were all very grateful that Munthar was able to arrange concrete cabins for us to sleep in and bonus, there were showers (though cold) available so I was able to have a quick wash before bed.

**Day 2**

We crawled out of our bunkers with a light dusting of sand on everything. It was hard to keep absolutely everything sand tight but, so it goes with sandstorms. As Munthar bemoaned the high winds coming from the neighbors to the south, he joked “nothing good comes from Saudi Arabia.”

We had a really interesting breakfast. Two other women joined us who were also doing the Dana to Petra trek, though with a different company. Last night, they also aborted their original camping plans and sheltered in the camp with walls, but we only briefly chatted with them to ask where they were from and otherwise had dined separately. This morning, we all huddled around one area of the walled dining area that was more protected from the wind and we got to know them a bit better. These two women were from Europe. They had come to Jordan many years ago and fell in love with Bedouin men. One was married to a Bedouin and another was “close.” It was so interesting to hear their experiences with maintaining a long distance relationship with people who have such a different culture. The French woman talked about how she had just been able to communicate to him that not disappearing without a word for weeks on end didn’t work for her and he was now starting to send messages to her daily while they were apart. She said that while it sounds crazy to celebrate something as simple as that, it’s a big deal for her partner whose culture is not like that at all and much more carefree. We found her honesty about how difficult it was at times to be really self-reflective as she talked about how on her first trip, she was naive and really also fell for the Bedouin nomadic and carefree lifestyle, but it isn’t necessarily so easy and carefree all the time, especially bridging cultures. I think we all found her commitment to maintaining and nurturing the relationship over five plus years to be extraordinary; any relationship, whether romantic or not, requires a commitment from both ends to trust in each other and commit to bridging across differences. But when the river that must be bridged is so wide, in my eyes, that seems to require a more extraordinary sense of will.

We parted ways after we loaded up on our hummus packs and maamouls (I need to figure out if I can import or make the cardamom maamoul which was so so yummy. More cardamom than date if I’m honest, but I liked it that way). Sadly they were taking a slightly different route to get to Petra (where their Bedouin partners are from) so that they ended up there a day faster than us so we didn’t cross paths again. We continued our journey through the desert, with some wind but not as much as overnight. The views this day were better than the last.We passed through some gorgeous desert lands where we could really see all the sand that the winds had kicked up. We passed through some rocky passages that snaked between tall black stone walls that looked shiny in the fuzzy sunny sky. We had some beautiful views of some domed stone structures, similar to the white domes of Dana but larger and with clearly stratified layers. There was a small waterfall and pool where we lunched, where Kevin and Christian also went in for a dip. We also saw some of the first signs of the Nabataeans' water control structures as we walked through a carved aqueduct running through the walls of stone.

Sadly, we couldn’t camp this night either as the Saudi winds continued to batter our planned camp site. This time, we ended our trek at a 4x4 road a little past where we would have camped and one of our hosts came by in his pickup truck to pick us up. We crammed (four butts in the back row of seats) into the pickup with Munthar wrapping himself in five blankets and chucking himself into the bed. We rattled our way up a large hill for about forty-five minutes until we reached a large rectangular shelter that was nestled into the ridge like a port-a-ledge. We got ourselves comfortable into the single large room for the evening.

This was probably one of my favorite evenings. We had such a wonderful set of folks with us for the evening. One was a young boy (different from Ayoub… I accidentally called him Ayoub and he looked at me quizzically when I realized my mistake) who could not get enough of playing a cups game with all of us. He had two cups, a plate and a rock. He would put the rock in one of the cups and shake it back and forth and then slam the cups onto the plate. His opponent would have to guess which cup it was underneath. And so it went on and on until one of us would get a little tired, which didn't matter to him because he would move on to the next person. He was endlessly entertained by the game and only paused to eat and eventually sleep.

We also had, joining us, a 97-year old man. Munthar and Mustafa and some of the other hosts had a great time chatting away with the man who was a bit hard of hearing so the room was pleasantly shout-y as the men yelled at each other enthusiastically. Among the English speakers, we talked about random things like “third tier superpowers.” This is something Maria and Christian brought up and I will have to steal it. A first tier superpower is something that is truly extraordinarily supernatural, like being able to teleport or become invisible. A second tier superpower is still a supernatural power, but less exciting, like being able to levitate something if it’s less than a few grams in weight. A third tier superpower is something that is distinctly human but is quite exciting and enviable. Mine is being able to sleep on planes.

After dinner (again, a spectacular feast by Mustafa and his older son), we started to roll out our sleeping bags around the perimeter of the room. This room, like most of the other Jordanian dining/kitchen/hang out rooms, had cushions lining the perimeter that acted like natural sleeping mats for our sleeping bags. We all really enjoyed our adult sleepover and funny enough, Munthar and one of the other hosts tried to hang a “privacy curtain” between us and the hosts. The gesture was appreciated but it definitely shielded very little and as we watched them try to hang it on some electrical cables, we all chimed that it wasn’t really necessary. Someone getting electrocuted in the name of privacy definitely doesn’t seem worthwhile. And off to bed we went! I slept surprisingly well given the circumstances and was very grateful not to be out camping while the wind, once again, howled as predicted outside.

**Day 3**

This might be the first time that I have not heard the extremely jarring iPhone alarm go off in a group sleeping situation (e.g. hostel, crazy packed ski trip, etc.). It seems our Jordanian hosts and our hiking buddies have gentle, quiet phone alarms. I genuinely woke up thinking, ahhh, “what a nice way to wake up” and felt great, even though I didn’t sleep very soundly all night. Weirdly, my toes were cold even though the rest of my body was warm enough.

I finished my morning ablutions first and hunkered down next to the 97-year old grandfather who was huddled near a small heater also with another older man, eating breakfast. I learned a new combination of food for breakfast: pita with a triangle of soft cheese (like Laughing Cow). The men would first heat a circle of pita against the heater and after warmed, unwrap a cheese triangle, plop it on an edge of the pita and start dabbing away at it with bits of pita torn from the other edges. No plate needed! 

Soon the larger breakfast was served and Munthar very effectively moved us all to the breakfast area on the floor by swinging the heater to point towards the plates of hummus, eggs, labneh, halva, and more. We were all crowded around the heater by this point and it didn’t take long before we were chowing down, this time Jordanian style, forgoing plates to dig into the dips and dishes family style. Honestly, my favorite might have been the olive oil and za’atar. I need to learn how to make this top tier level of za’atar. The scrambled eggs were shockingly good. We tend to avoid pre cooked scrambled eggs as they are usually pretty dry and rubbery but these were genuinely tasty and still soft. Jordanians are truly kitchen magicians. We had a fun time leisurely eating breakfast, watching as Munthar tried to get the 97-year old to recite some poetry for the camera (it took a couple of tries, but eventually he succeeded!). He really is unbelievably spry and full of energy for that age! 

Eventually we were on our way (trucked back to the trailhead in the squished pickup again) and we slowly trekked through the blasting wind and sand. Man, this was some of the toughest winds I’ve had to hike though for such an extended period of time. It was a bit chilly so we had on a few layers and also my head was almost entirely covered. I had on a scarf on my head to cover my hair, sunglasses to protect my eyes, and another Buff to cover my nose and mouth and neck. I had to give up on the scarf quickly as it was too slick and was getting blown off. My sunglasses were nearly blown off a few times and I had to keep one hand on my face to prevent them from flying away. I was getting pushed around quite a bit and eventually took up leaning and walking slightly to the left (towards the east) to counteract the Easterly winds and accordingly walk roughly in a straight line. It was definitely an adventure!

We are extremely dusty.

Eventually, after a descent and ascent, the winds did calm down substantially. We had some really amazing views of the rock formations this day, including hiking across some fossilized corals, through some village ruins (the village was abandoned after a landslide buried their spring which was their sole water source) and a small niche carved into rock that the Nabateans used to use as a place to worship one of their gods. A few months ago, I read a book called The Control of Nature where one of the chapters talked about how the people near the San Gabriel mountains near Los Angeles live near mountains that are full of loose scree and every now and then, after a strong earthquake shake plus some strong rainfall, the scree turns into a dangerous landslide that destroys the homes in the area. This area of Jordan actually has the exact same feature; Munthar explained that sometimes, the loose rock will flow after a strong rainfall, wiping away everything in its path. It's mostly Bedouins that live in the area who are really well connected with the land but definitely, every year there is some risk with spending the winter time in the lower valley. Unlike Los Angeles, there are no debris basins here to capture some of the rocks and protect the citizens (though as the book says, perhaps the residents who choose to build their houses up in the San Gabriel’s have overconfidence in those debris basins).

We saw a bunch of juniper trees and learned how to say juniper in Arabic. Here’s how. There are two syllables. Syllable one: pretend you’re in a dentist office and you have your mouth open and the dentist hits a nerve. The sound you might make is syllable one. Syllable two: pretend you are a lion speaking Spanish. Say “rawr” and roll the r’s. AHR-RAR! Juniper. The more aggressive the better. Munthar taught us some tongue twisters that involved that word and everyone did not even attempt to have a go at it. Arabic is tricky! 

A couple kilometers from camp, we stopped by a Bedouin tent. We’d seen a lot of the tents while on the hike and across Jordan while we were road tripping but this time, we were invited in for some coffee and tea. Munthar showed us how to accept the Arabic coffee, brewed very strongly with cardamom, but only thankfully served a couple tablespoons at a time in tiny paper cups. He said that a long time ago when the Bedouins were planning raids, coffee would be served by someone who was deaf so that they could not hear the plans and potentially tell them to an enemy tribe. Because of this, people would use signals to communicate with the person serving coffee. First, the cup had to be received with the right hand. After one cup, if you wanted more, then you would tilt the cup back and forth (sort of shaking it). If you didn’t want more, you would put the cup down. If you had a second cup of coffee, it meant you were a tribe mate. If you had a third cup, it meant that you were committing yourself to the protection of the tribe and were willing to stand up and defend the tribe or be there in times of need.

In addition to coffee, we were also served sweetened black tea (this time, extremely sweet, as the Bedouins prefer). We all sort of struggled through because we didn’t want to be rude, but it’s tricky since all of us drink far less caffeine typically, much less sweet, and almost never around four pm or later. After hanging out for a bit longer, we continued on our journey for the last couple of kilometers to our camp. We were treated to showers, our own cabins, and electricity! The shower was very welcome to soap off all the dust and sand from the day (though the shower did alternate between ice cold and boiling hot). And per usual, we were served a huge spread of amazing Jordanian food, including some of the yummiest, smokiest mutabal. It was such an incredible campsite to be at, flanked by towering limestone formations. We were told that tomorrow would be a hot day because the current spell of easterly winds were coming to an end which was a portend for hotter than usual days. My legs were actually a bit sore today so I was quite thankful for the mint tea that was served (without sugar to the horror and befuddlement of our host) for a good night’s sleep. 

After dinner and playing some cards for a little while (Maria and Christian taught us a fun game called “Up and Down the River”), we were ushered outside towards a small fire that had been lit to watch “a dance.” Color me intrigued! We huddled around the fire and the men sang us a song while they rocked from side to side and clapped . We enthusiastically clapped along and my only regret was not joining them while attempting to enunciate the Arabic syllables. After the dance (not sure what the meaning of the dance was), we continued chatting away while Munthar translated. These hosts were really an absolute joy to hang out with. They got such a kick out of saying “AHR-RAR!” every time we were asked anything. What type of wood was burning in the fire? AHR-RAR! Though turns out that was the correct answer! They got a kick out of us being absolutely horrified by the amount of sugar they claimed to consume each month. It got wilder and wilder until one of the hosts claimed FIFTY KILOGRAMS A MONTH! He wins. I’m still petrified for their health. Eventually the fire gave out an almighty crackle that had us all scrambling so we called it a night and turned into our comfy individual cabins for a solid night’s rest. I think I’m getting pretty good at sleeping even with caffeine in my body.

A dance by the campfire.

**Day 4**

I was quite sad to leave this camp because of our wonderful, entertaining hosts but we did indeed have to leave. We packed up, grabbed our classic hummus tetra paks and maamouls and started our hike, now all clad in shorts and tees as the wind was indeed gone. This day, we walked into an area called Little Petra which is like the appetizer before the entree of Petra. Prior to walking into Little Petra, we started to see our first signs of civilization: cultivated pomegranate trees (unfortunately pom season was over and the remaining ones likely were rotten on the inside) and thick black pipes distributing water over the various farm areas. We saw some early signs of the Nabataeans' former presence as we climbed up onto a rocky ledge and followed one of their aqueducts towards Little Petra. I was quite excited to see this because one of the things that the podcast highlighted was the Nabataeans' prowess with water engineering. It had such a strong foothold in the area because unlike any other group, they were able to find ways to store and transport water making Petra itself an important stop for all merchants wishing to use the paths of the Silk Road for trade. In the middle of the desert, any group that could control water, controlled the land.

Arriving into Little Petra, we climbed up a small staircase into a small canyon between the walls where the first of shops offering tchotchkes were set up. While less interested in the shopkeeper’s offerings, we all took strong interest in the cats and dog (yep, singular dog) that were roaming the shops. The cutest little kitten was absolutely obsessed with Christian and I enjoyed watching it play and letting out the cutest soft purrs and mews. Once through the narrow gorge, we debouched out into a wider area where we started to see the famous carved façades, chiseled right into the canyon walls. Having been to Petra now, it seems less magnificent, but at the time, it was really impressive to see the columns and deep caverns bored into the stone, some with ceilings and walls blackened from when they (and more recent Bedouins) used to cook. We stopped at a I found the cutest cat with only one eye who originally was fighting with another cat, but as I crouched down, surprised me by leaping onto my lap, crawling right over my shoulder and settling its butt down on the top of my backpack while perching itself on my shoulder. I wanted to keep the cat but alas, we needed to continue on our journey to camp.

For our final night, we stayed at a larger and more modern camp just around the corner of the more common entrance to Little Petra. This place had a proper shower, individual cabins, and electricity inside the cabins! We arrived at the camp quite early so after lounging around/taking naps, we all hopped over the concrete wall around the camp to explore the nearby sand dunes. They were small dunes, but still really fun to run down. We watched the last rays of sun light up the drippy walls and finally dip below the stone ridge line, before trundling back over to camp for our showers.

The winning feature of the camp was a large fireplace inside the communal dining tent that was raging when I went in after taking a hot shower. I plopped myself down with my laptop while waiting for the others and for dinner to be served. We ate another yummy meal, watched the hosts futilely shoo away the cats from the buffet area and spent some more time just chatting away with our trekking companions. Alas, Munthar wasn’t feeling so well so he tucked in early, but we stayed up a bit longer continuing to learn about our experiences and exchange stories. I think we all felt a little sad that this was our final night together but I’m sure we’ll see each other again sometime. 

**Day 5**

Breakfast was more western style with every person getting their own plates but Christian made a communal plate of olive oil and za’atar for us to dig into which we did voraciously. As a shock to us all, there were two pots of tea: one with sugar and one without. We drank a lot of unsweetened tea. 

Soon enough we were on our way to walk the last six kilometers that would deposit us at the backdoor of Petra at the Monastery. We were joined by another person today, Mahmoud, who was born in one of the caves in Petra and grew up playing in the city before the site was turned into a UNESCO World Heritage site and became a protected place for tourists. He was our cultural guide while we walked through Petra. It was probably really nice for Munthar to have someone else be the guide for the day because he still was struggling with his stomach a bit and Mahmoud was really a fantastic and knowledgeable guide. 

Those last six kilometers to Petra are spectacular in and of itself with beautiful views of Wadi Araba that borders Petra. I still remember the first glimpse of the Monastery though; for a second, my brain thought I was looking at a trail cairn and I thought “huh, that’s a big cairn.” One more thought later and I realized it was the top of the largest carved building in Petra looming ahead. Funnily enough, I wasn’t the only one who thought it was a large cairn before realizing what it really was.

Before we reached the Monastery, Mahmoud led us to some additional cavities in the walls that were situated right next door. Prime examples of the Nabatean prowess in water conservation, these were a series of water tanks where each one was placed slightly below the next so that overflow of water could be captured. Apparently there are still excavation projects in progress to continue to unearth these water tanks and we saw some construction zone areas.

Finally, we reached the Monastery. It really is spectacular. And huge. I was stunned by the sheer size of the façade.  There weren’t too many people at the Monastery because a) there aren’t many tourists in Jordan in the first place and b) in order to reach the Monastery the normal way, it’s a sizable and fairly relentless uphill climb from the usual entrance of Petra through the Siq. Most of the caverns that populate Petra have tombs underneath and the Monastery, likewise, contained tombs, though the upper level has no cavity and is just a façade. We learned that the façades that specifically had stairs carved into the rock right above the door was a giveaway that the cavern contained tombs as the stairs were a path for the deceased to climb their way to heaven.

</figcaption>

One of my favorite areas was the Royal Tombs. These were a set of very ornately decorated tombs with huge rooms inside that we could explore on our own. The Rainbow Tomb was especially special with the rock swirled into different colors. It reminded me of making a marbled icing cake. First you arbitrarily splotch on different coloured frosting on a cake, then you freeze it, then you use a tall bench scraper to scrape away thin layers of the frozen frosting until voila, a marble pattern appears. It’s very magical and I wondered if the Nabataeans' also felt like that while carving the ornate tombs. Did they also know ahead of time the gorgeous colors that were just underneath what looked like plain red rock?

The Rainbow Tomb.

</figcaption>

We had some time by ourselves to explore and climb the tombs which was really fun and then per instruction by Mahmoud, we visited “the most beautiful toilet in the world.” These toilets were repurposed Nabataean caves and had the gorgeous swirled coloured ceiling which was indeed beautiful. The tombs continued on for quite a while though they weren’t as large or decorated as the Royal Tombs. Eventually, Mahmoud took us through the Siq, the narrow canyon that most visitors enter from and told us to look for some coins on the ground. It was a red herring that I totally bought into (and I think no one else did). He eventually told us to turn around as we were staring at the ground and we saw our first glimpse of the Treasury.

That first glimpse that we got, through the Siq, showing a small fraction of the whole façade yet giving a clear sense of the majesty to come, is the same one that merchants would get as they entered the Nabataean capital. It must have been a sight to behold, especially after ages of slogging through the desert. The images that are carved in the rock represent Egyptian, Greek, and Nabataean gods and goddesses as an effort to make the first sight of the city welcoming to all people. One amusing story is that the Treasury is called such because there is an urn at the top that people believed contained valuable Egyptian treasures. While the Bedouins lived in Petra, they shot rifles at the urn to try to break it but of course, it's just rock. So now there are bullet holes in the façade.

After having our fill of Treasury views and pictures, we continued meandering through the Siq, taking more photos of more sandstone carvings until we finally reached the visitors' center. Alas, it was time to part ways. Maria and Christian were off to Aqaba, Esther back to Amman, and we decided to spend the night in Petra to have one more day to explore the vast city.

**Bonus Petra Day**

Petra is actually a huge city with a bunch of hiking trails so on our second day, we decided to hike one of the paths to the High Place of Sacrifice. We had fun walking through the Siq again, visiting the Treasury again, which was on the way to the start of the trail, and then climbing up the many steps to reach the high vantage point of the High Place of Sacrifice. It was very fun to be up high and we had a bit of company with several military guys, posted on various peaks in the area. From above, we saw a small caravan of golf carts that were heavily protected with folks from the military who appeared to be doing some normal sightseeing, but we don't know who was in the carts.

We briefly visited the Petra Museum at the end of the day which we rushed a bit because we ended up spending too long in Petra and had to catch the bus back to Amman. They had some pretty cool pieces of jewelry from 6500-7000 BC that looked really cool. I wonder if there are jewelry artists that pull their designs from prehistoric times because some of the craftsmanship is truly astonishing and beautiful. That would be a cool concept.

And that was the end of our Dana to Petra trek! One day, we would love to go back to do the continuation of that trek from Petra to Wadi Rum which Munthar raved about with beautiful desert landscapes. But this was pretty amazing and we're really glad we had such amazing company to do the hike with!
