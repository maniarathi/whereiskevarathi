I think the pilots that fly the route between Santiago and Calama, the airport to access the Atacama Desert, must be exceptional. It’s a short flight but it flies over some unreal and unforgiving landscapes that are created by the unique conditions of two mountain ranges creating a double rain shadow effect. As we got closer and closer to Calama, the flight became more and more turbulent (not a cloud in sight though!) but when we touched down, I remember my jaw dropping because I _barely_ felt the landing. It was that butter smooth. Same thing on the way back to Santiago. I was honestly bracing myself a bit for the landing because most flights have felt more like how I body slam into bed after a really tiring day. A leap, a thud, and Kevin gets a little airtime.

The Atacama Desert was a really unique place to visit. I was a little nervous to visit the place because the main town, San Pedro de Atacama, sits at 2500 meters (~8000 feet) and some of the sights to see are even higher (~4300 meters or more than 14,000 feet) and I’ve gotten altitude sickness before right around 13 to 14 thousand feet. Our very kind Airbnb host in Santiago gave me a box of acetazolamide (known as the brand name Diamox) which I started taking once we arrived in San Pedro. I hesitated a bit about taking it because I had heard that the most common side effect was that one would need to pee _very_ often (and so may cause dehydration which can manifest as altitude sickness symptoms like headaches), but I was very lucky; I neither had any altitude sickness symptoms nor did I have any side effects from the medicine! This gave me a lot of confidence going into Bolivia afterwards since we’d be going up to 16,000 feet.

In the Atacama Desert we essentially spent 4 days driving around to the different features of the land. One thing that surprised me was the amount of wildlife in the area. I took some of my best wildlife pictures in Atacama that I’ll post below.

Flamingos are such graceful fliers! I had no idea!

I love the composition of this photo with the single resting vicuña beside Laguna Miscanti. It almost looks surreal.

Perhaps somewhat ironically, the most wonderful features of the Atacama Desert are actually the high altitude lakes (or “lagunas”) that pepper the expanse. These lagunas are typically either very salty or contain brackish water. One of my favorite experiences was floating in Laguna Cejar which is so salty that you can’t sink. It was such a weird feeling of nearly sitting in the water without needing to tread water. It makes swimming so much easier when you don’t need to worry about floating! After getting out of the lake, I had a full additional skin of salt crusted all over me. Thankfully they had freshwater showers available!

Another favorite experience was seeing the El Tatio Geysers. These high altitude geysers (4300 meters/14,000 feet) are best seen at dawn so we braved the 4am alarm to head up to the geysers before sunrise. After sunrise, the air warms up sufficiently that the steam is more difficult to see.

The temperature swings in the desert are really remarkable. In the peak of the day around 2 or 3pm, I could feel the sun really beating down and the heat was pretty relentless. I learned very quickly that diligent sunscreen application is a must. That is, not just one thorough sunscreen application, but remembering to sunscreen every couple hours as the bottle directs. I tend to be a little lazy about applying sunscreen because I don’t burn as easily (I know, not the best habit), but the high altitude plus cloudless skies made me quickly realize that it wouldn’t do. But as soon as the sun went down or if we gained a thousand meters of altitude, I would need to bust out my ski jacket, hat, and gloves because the temperature would drop quickly. At the geysers, I was as bundled up as I was for the coldest days in Patagonia with sunscreen slathered on the few exposed areas of my face.

Atacama was full of landscapes that really made me wonder if I was still on planet Earth. I’ll add some more pictures below of two other areas we visited which were Pierdras Rojas and Valle de la Luna (Valley of the Moon). One felt like I was on Mars and the other felt like I was on the Moon.

Valle de la Luna. I hope that one day I can visit space, but if that’s not in the cards for me, this place really does feel like it could sub in for a visit to the Moon.

One final surreal thing we did was go on a stargazing excursion. The night sky in the desert is absolutely stunning to see as there is very little light pollution. We had a really cool guide who had a PhD in Astronomy. Towards the end, Kevin asked him about his research and 98% of it went straight over my head. Beyond his enthusiasm about his research area (something involving measuring the velocity of galaxies), he taught us a lot about the Southern night sky and I was in awe about how much I could see with my naked eye. One fascinating thing we learned is that the indigenous people of the desert also have named constellations, but instead of drawing lines between the stars to form a shape, they look at the darkness between a group of stars to figure out what it looks like and name the constellation accordingly. During this tour, we also got to look at the stars through a telescope where we were able to see star clusters. My favorite star was an orange-colored star named Betelgeuse that is either going to explode soon or has exploded already. I find it amazing that one day, the light from its explosion will reach Earth and be as bright as the moon in our night sky.

Our stargazing guides had a long exposure camera set up to be able to take photos against the Milky Way!

One random fun fact related to the stargazing excursion: I learned that Chile has one of the largest lithium reserves of which 90% is in the Atacama Desert. When we went stargazing, we could see two faint glows in the distance. One was the light coming from San Pedro and the other was from a distant lithium mine!
